The Dow soars, wages don’t. Inequality in a nutshell.
The rumors are true. Today we’re announcing the Courage to Change PAC - and we need your help. We are pushing the envelope in DC by rewarding those who reject lobbyist money, fight for working families,&amp; welcome newcomers. Change takes courage. Let’s go:
Trump’s “imminent threat” is the new “WMD”: there’s no evidence given for either.
I’m also not the only one. Expanding a House majority is critical, which is why I regularly (and happily) fundraise sizeable amounts for fellow members. I also believe that a Dem majority should be transformative, which is why I give strategically. Seems fair, no?
I give quite a bit to fellow Dems - we’ve fundraised over $300,000 for others (more than my “dues”), w/ over 50% going to swing seats. DCCC made clear that they will blacklist any org that helps progressive candidates like me. I can choose not to fund that kind of exclusion.
The people who tell you we DO have war money but DON’T have healthcare money, tuition-free money, infrastructure money, or Green New Deal money are playing games with you.
How about “I am a Republican and will be voting Democrat because Trump is an authoritarian threat to our collective wellbeing.”
I find it highly amusing that my coworkers angrily yell stuff like this and then clutch their pearls and cry when they are called out for their racism
Are people actually upset over discussing multiparty systems? The conversation is helpful for understanding difference among Dems. People are acting like a Dem didn’t just join the GOP a few wks ago. Other safe Dems actually fundraise for Republicans. That’s not “moderate.”
Please keep your thoughts today w/ Puerto Rico. Earthquakes began to hit last night, tearing down schools &amp; buildings. Island-wide blackouts reported. My abuela relies on oxygen, and the power outage means she’s not breathing as she should - just one of many such stories. 🇵🇷
Yes! 🐶 the goal is to train him to be a community pup. Ideally we want to work to the point where he can enjoy town halls, be an Amtrak pup, come to the office, etc. But first, naps 😴
I hate to break it to you, but in the US there *are* party leaders with immense, concentrated power (via fundraising and other means), and they DO create enormous pressure to have their caucus members vote in set directions. I know this because it’s my job.
In our current primary field, some people treat healthcare as a right, and others don’t. Doesn’t make you enemies, it makes you different. Abroad, being in diff parties doesn’t mean you dislike each other. It means you acknowledge your differences and come together in coalition.
Yeah, I don’t know why people are up in arms about this. Many other countries have multiparty democracies, where several parties come together in a coalition to govern. In another country, I’d be in a Labor Party like Jacinda Ardern. Our primary field would cover 2-3 parties.
This clip is from 6 months ago. Pay attention. The Trump admin has been chomping at the bit to pursue conflict with Iran for months. We must act now to save lives, protect the innocent, and limit the immense damage that has been done. War isn’t “smart” - it’s barbaric.
Targeting cultural sites is a war crime. It should also go without saying that sites like Persepolis (&amp; its PEOPLE) are not only treasures to Iranians, they are gifts to humanity. They tell humanity’s story - that is why authoritarians target them. They want to erase history.
Remember when everyone mocked us for saying that fighting climate change is going to take a WWII-scale mobilization? Well, it’s already starting to happen. The question is: will we mobilize reactively to destruction, or will we act proactively for prevention?
It was truly incredible this morning to join thousands of New Yorkers coming together against antisemitism and in active fellowship, allyship, and support for our Jewish brothers and sisters. Always an honor to march together, @bradlander!
This is a war crime. Threatening to target and kill innocent families, women and children - which is what you’re doing by targeting cultural sites - does not make you a “tough guy.” It does not make you “strategic.” It makes you a monster.
Happy birthday @RepKatiePorter! 🎂
I’m just gonna leave this right here
Happy 1 year anniversary to dunking on haters and advocating for peace✌🏽
Here at home, inequality in military service means poorer areas of the country bear greater sacrifices for war. Abroad, 100s of 1000s of innocent people - dismissed as statistics - have had their lives ravaged by the consequences of our decisions.
War is a class conflict, too. The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions. It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence. It is often the vulnerable, the poor, &amp; working people -who had little to no say in conflict - who pay the price.
(are** selling us)
2. Reintroduce &amp; vote on @RepRoKhanna’s bipartisan NDAA amendment, which blocks $ offensive action to Iran. This amendment passed the House w/ bipartisan support not long ago, and was later gutted in negotiations. We can bring it back as a standalone bill.
Congress now has a moral and legal obligation to reassert its power to stop this war and protect innocent people from horrific consequences. We have two immediate options: 1. Vote on a War Powers Resolution, which requires Trump to attain Congressional approval. 2.
War advocates start off saying “we all want peace, but...” or “it’s too late...” &amp; frame a pro-peace agenda as naïve to realpolitik. Don’t give into this gaslighting. The same folks selling us Iraq and selling us this latest provocation of violence. We cannot repeat this cycle.
Right now is the moment to decide if you are pro-peace or not. The cheerleaders of war, removed from its true cost, will gladly convince you that up is down - just as they did in Iraq in ‘03. But war does not establish peace. War does not create security. War endangers us all.
Last night the President engaged in what is widely being recognized as an act of war against Iran, one that now risks the lives of millions of innocent people. Now is the moment to prevent war &amp; protect innocent people - the question for many is how, publicly &amp; Congressionally:
This is just the beginning of our new climate reality. We must dramatically draw down CO2 to save our livable planet. And to those who mock the science saying we have 10 yrs to fix it: try telling the thousands of people displaced by disasters that they’re “just overreacting.”
I’m really proud of @JulianCastro and his campaign. He ran with true purpose and intentionality. His team uplifted important conversations and took on issues that most candidates shy away from. At their best, campaigns can be acts of service. Julián’s campaign exemplified that.
The major - &amp; I mean MAJOR - reason I‘m able to work for the public the way I do is bc I rely on grassroots donations. I don’t rely on big money or parties for the wealthy to fund my election. I rely on you. Our avg donation is $16. Help us keep going:
In the past decade I lost my dad, returned to the Bronx, fought off foreclosure w my family, struggled w/ student loans, &amp; worked shifts in restaurants for years. At my lowest, I struggled w/ the thought that I’d never amount to anything. To those going through it: Keep going.
Returning home heartsick over the attacks in Monsey &amp; NYC over Hanukkah. We must confront antisemitism wherever we see it, &amp; combat the rising tide of domestic terrorism fueled by bigotry. And we can look up to the bravery &amp; heroism in our communities in the face of darkness ⬇️
Keep going! You’re so close to getting it! ☺️🛫
Keep me updated 😉
Off to spend the holidays with family. Feliz Nochebuena, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and a wonderful New Year to all! ✨
When a progressive hero cosigns the policy plank 😭
🤣
Wishing all our families celebrating in NY-14 and beyond a #HappyHanukkah! May our celebrations be filled with family, light, hope, and love. 💟
A lot of people who struggle with imposter syndrome haven’t realized yet that what they’re actually competing with is intergenerational wealth. Be patient and kind to yourself.
See you tomorrow, LA!
There are ways to restructure SALT deductions to provide relief to middle class families - and there are several different SALT repeal bills in the House. McConnell has indicated this bill is going in the Senate graveyard. With another pass, I think we can get this done right.
This SALT bill does’t bring things back to the pre-GOP norm we’re used to. Due to expansion of the standard deduction, folks who want to claim SALT now need to pay ~$24k+ in state and local to get it. For those families just over that, the benefit may not be as high. /1
They’re coming into the House, too. (No Christmas card here - but no coal, either)
Romans 1:25.
No normal person would be able to get away with attempting to extort a foreign power to compromise our country. But all too often, the most corrupt and powerful people grow so accustomed to life with impunity that standard accountability feels to them like unjust persecution.
¡Gracias!
I’m nervous for this all-Spanish town hall, but I also know that the only way I’m going to improve my Spanish is by practicing it! - Nevada: Únete a nosotros este Domingo para un... town hall(?) en Español, y probablemente con un poquito de “spanglish” también 😉⬇️
Yeeeeesssss!!
They’re also upset that I stated 66 “choices” is too many. It is! Healthcare is not H&amp;M. Insurance is a complex financial product for the doctor. Costs are skyrocketing largely due to the financialization of our health. Streamlining our system &amp; covering more isn’t a bad thing.
A lot of Republicans are quite upset about critiquing the frame of “choice” within our health insurance system, with many staying that those who struggle to pick the best insurance option are simply “too dumb” to know better. But the complexity of our system is by design. ⬇️
And once again, make sure to get insured if you can at Yes, it’s a pain. But it is worth it. I know some folks are bristling at the fact that I am pointing that out, but we have to acknowledge the reality so we can move forward together.
And as someone who has now experienced many parts of the insurance spectrum (being uninsured, underinsured, and adequately insured) I don’t see how anyone can think our current healthcare system only needs a 10% improvement or a just few tweaks. We need #MedicareForAll.
While I am VERY thankful to finally have health insurance, it is a moral outrage that it took me *getting elected to Congress* for that to happen. The US needs to become an advanced society. That includes establishing healthcare as a right to all people.
Members of Congress also have to buy their plans off the exchange. They are Gold plans that are partially subsidized. That means I get to “choose” btwn 66 complex financial products. This is absurd. No person should go without healthcare, &amp;no one should go through this, either.
And to our constituents in NY - you have until Jan 31st to enroll, but tonight is the deadline for your insurance to kick in on 1/1! Do it here:
For those who can’t afford it, I feel you. I went uninsured for years bc I made “too much” for a subsidy, but couldn’t afford ~$200/mo for a $7000 deductible. A coworker went through her entire pregnancy uninsured.That nightmare is a major reason why I fight for #MedicareForAll.
Reminder: tonight is the deadline for open enrollment - that time of the year we are reminded of how amazing “choice” is in our insurance system (😂). For today, get insured if you can at For tomorrow, end healthcare profiteering with #MedicareForAll.

For anyone who wants to run away from Santacon, my monthly town hall starts at 4pm 😉
By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump gave up his seat at the table for global climate negotiations a long time ago. He’s a glorified fossil fuel lobbyist sabotaging the effort to save our future. Yet he’s not the only one - there are plenty more in our gov &amp; abroad.
An utter failure. #COP25 &amp; conferences like it are intended to be actual negotiations to urgently drawdown global carbon emissions - not cocktail parties to make politicians feel better about themselves as they squash dissent &amp; sell off our futures to fossil fuel interests.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
The way it was explained to me was that it defuses fights. When individuals debate hot button issues in the second person ex. “you are hurting people!”, debate can devolve quickly as opposed to being forced to say “my colleague’s assertion of X is insulting to Y community”
The House has a full staff of parliamentarians to help members with all of this. It’s a very important job! Another rule is that members aren’t really allowed to speak in the 2nd person on the House floor/ in committee. That is why people who aren’t friends say “my good friend”
Sometimes being a new member of the House feels like being in Hogwarts. There are lots of arcane parliamentary phrases (I jokingly call them “magic spells”) one can learn to speak on the floor or gain exceptions. Deep knowledge of these rules is rare but can be powerful.
This phrase is spoken during markups, which are different from hearings. In markups, members are debating the actual written substance of legislation - be it a bill, or (in this case) articles. “Strike the last word” means you’re adding a pro forma amendment &amp; using it to talk.

Usual markup debate rules mean that each amendment can only be debated for 10 minutes (5 for &amp; against). “Strike the last word” is the magic spell to talk beyond that. This can create an endless cycle sometimes, bc one side rarely wants to allow the other to get the last word.

This video is about the UK, but it might as well have been produced about the United States. The hoarding of wealth by the few is coming at the cost of peoples’ lives. The only way we change is with a massive surge of *new* voters at the polls. UK, Vote!
Proud to join @RepRoKhanna in voting NO on the NDAA. As Ro says, when Pres Obama left, the US defense budget was $618 BILLION/year. It will now be $120 billion more than that. No pundits ask how we pay for it, or blast it as “free stuff.” We just accept it. Pay attention.
If you think I’m joking about the spa weekend bit, I’m not! One of the sneaky and most corrupting aspects of lobbying is to court a members’ staff - especially their chief. It just happened earlier this year with lobbyists fighting Medicare for All:
Health insurance costs have gone up *20%* in the past year. This is the healthcare system of “choice” that so many politicians are committed to protecting with small, incremental tweaks. Meanwhile, Big Pharma &amp; insurance lobbyists treat Congressional staffers to spa weekends.
What does a Green New Deal mean for housing? How do we center jobs AND justice with ambitious industrial policy to save our planet? Watch and see. ⬇️ (Narrated by @TedDanson, produced by @TheLeap_Org)
Incredible, inspiring, and well-deserved. The time for climate action and youth movements is now.
“Immigrants are dirty” is a lazy, tired, racist trope. Secondly, environmental injustice is a major motivation as to why we introduced and wrote the Green New Deal the way we did in the first place.
I go back and forth on whether to go on Fox News. The main reason I haven’t is squaring the fact that the ad revenue from it bankrolls a white supremacist sympathizer to broadcast an hour-long production of unmitigated racism, without any accountability whatsoever.
This is a big deal. Thank you @CPDAction for endorsing @BernieSanders for President! Together we will fight for an advanced, multiracial society that centers the working class. Thrilled to be in this together 🌹
Me too. 💜
Yes! And equal paternity/parental leave is just as critical. Non-birthing parents are JUST as important.We have to end the stigma that only birthing parents should take time off. It takes a village. Leave isn’t only about physical recovery; it’s about starting life as a family.
At a bare minimum, we need to fight for 3 months paid family leave in the United States. Ideally, I believe we should have 6-12 months of paid leave - just as many other industrial nations do.
Puppies aren’t separated from their moms until ~8 weeks. Less than that is thought of as harmful or abusive. One of the most common lengths of US paid family leave is ~6 weeks. So yes, when we “let the market decide”on parental leave, “the market” treats people worse than dogs.
This is outright and atrocious antisemitism coming from the President, and it is dangerous.
It really means a lot to me. I know how precious people’s free time is, and the fact that Bronx &amp; Queens families choose to spend their time with me to ask important questions is very meaningful. So thanks everyone! See you again next weekend!
I am so thankful for how our NY-14 community pays attention. The Congressional schedule has members in DC most of the week, so that often means events on nights/weekends. But people make time for it 💜 It’s Sunday night in Jackson Heights &amp; we had a packed house talking policy!
“It wasn’t the first time I had tried to leave [my husband]; the last time... he made it clear to me that if I left, he would ruin me. So I went back.” Read Katie’s story and understand the toll of abusive partners &amp; cyber exploitation. No one should live in this kind of fear.
If Republicans were willing to scrutinize billionaires *half* as much as they scrutinize people on food stamps, this country would be a much better place.
- Also, and very importantly, these jobs are for FREE. The public was going to pay $3 billion in public subsidies &amp; millions in hard cash building Amazon’s campus for them- NYC residents were subsidizing Amazon tons per job. Now they‘re bringing work without the welfare.
- “It’s in Manhattan, not Queens”: If you live in NYC, you would know people commute to work. Amazon would not have paid taxes for many, many years and not contribute to fixing our crumbling subway system. So lots of added strain, no benefit.
While we’re here, let’s clear up some GOP disinfo: - “It’s 1500 jobs vs 25,000”: The 25,000 jobs figure was a 10-20 year fantasy # from Amazon, not a promise or agreement. In exchange for that lack of commitment, they wanted billions of public $. Their Y1 jobs projection was 700.
💞💞💞
You should know better. That 25k number was an unsubstantiated #, not a year 1 hiring figure. Nor was it a promise backed w/ consequences if it wasn’t met. 1,500 jobs off the bat is huge, &amp; a much better deal than paying billions for a fairy tale that would’ve displaced many.
Me waiting on the haters to apologize after we were proven right on Amazon and saved the public billions
Won’t you look at that: Amazon is coming to NYC anyway - *without* requiring the public to finance shady deals, helipad handouts for Jeff Bezos, &amp; corporate giveaways. Maybe the Trump admin should focus more on cutting public assistance to billionaires instead of poor families.

In other words: A single mother of a 19 year old gets denied food. A person who needs their car to drive to work gets denied food. A disabled person whose paperwork is in limbo for months gets denied food. Nice system you have there.
The devil (that starves low-income Americans) is in the details.
Or let’s talk about food stamps and cars! This is one of the wildest rules to me. If you have a busted car that’s worth a less than $5k (say, to drive to that work req), it can preclude you from food stamps. See how these “rules” start to stack up?
If you have severe depression (or any number of mental issues), everyday life is very difficult. But it’s really hard to get disability status in general for mental health issues. So if you need food stamps, and can’t afford a dr’s visit for a diagnosis/medicine, you go hungry.
These exclusionary “rules” sound great to anyone who hasn’t dealt with the actual lived experience. In truth it means paperwork, waiting, &amp; absurdist bureaucracy. Let’s talk about the example of severe depression, which is an elevated risk for people in economic hardship.
The rule ignores the reality of American life. Plenty of parents who support can’t claim “adult” (18+) children as dependents. Getting disability status is notoriously difficult &amp;food is an immediate need. What if someone has an undiagnosed mental issue, like severe depression?
My family relied on food stamps (EBT) when my dad died at 48. I was a student. If this happened then, we might’ve just starved. Now, many people will. It’s shameful how the GOP works overtime to create freebies for the rich while dissolving lifelines of those who need it most.
I was in that CBP facility. There were cameras and monitors everywhere. Are we really supposed to believe that every single camera and every single feed in the detention center happened to go offline the day that I and an entire Congressional delegation visited? I don’t.
Of course CBP is saying the tape “doesn’t exist.” Bc then everyone would see the horrifying conditions I was talking about. If the full footage was released, you’d see CBP officers sneaking photos of me in secure spaces, and migrant women on the floor w/ their hair falling out.
Siri, show me what classism looks like:
To our friends in the UK: please cherish, protect, &amp; continue investing in your healthcare system! Once Big Pharma &amp; special interests get their hands on it, it could take generations to regain. Millions of people in the US are fighting to have a system half as good as the NHS.
A combined household income of $100k isn’t even “children of millionaires” territory. That’s two parents making $50k/each. Does that sound rich to you? It’s not. It’s a working family. And just as tuition-free K-12 public school was an option, tuition-free K-16 should be too.
5. Lastly, and I can’t believe we have to remind people of this, but it’s GOOD to have classrooms (from pre-k through college!) to be socioeconomically integrated. Having students from different incomes &amp; backgrounds in the same classroom is good for society &amp; economic mobility.
3. When you start carving people out &amp; adding asterisks to who can benefit from goods that should be available to all, cracks in the system develop. 4. Many children of the elite want to go to private, Ivyesque schools anyway, which aren’t covered by tuition-free public college!
1. Universal public systems are designed to benefit EVERYBODY! Everyone contributes &amp; everyone enjoys. We don’t ban the rich from public schools, firefighters, or libraries bc they are public goods. 2. Universal systems that benefit everyone are stronger bc everyone’s invested!
This is a GOP talking point used to dismantle public systems, &amp; it’s sad to see a Dem candidate adopt it. Let’s talk about why Republicans are wrong on this. Just like rich kids can attend public school, they should be able to attend tuition-free public college. Here’s why.
Hoping everyone is enjoying a warm &amp; happy Thanksgiving. I am thankful for so much this year: my friends, family, and loved ones; the blessing of good health, &amp; the opportunity to serve our community and country. Gratitude is a practice! What are you grateful for this year? ⬇️
Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves “fiscally responsible,” yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression. Everything has a price. And an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in &amp; values all people.
None of the politicians who brand themselves “fiscally responsible” ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight. None of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration. Ask yourself why that is.
This is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about “pay-fors” in healthcare, housing, etc so often are made in bad faith. I see decisions made every day that cost the American public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it. /2
Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP. I saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill. Nobody cared then how we’d pay for it. Now ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students. Yet we were called radical for opposing it.
Abolish ICE.
None of this is a critique on lawmakers who dial for dollars - they don’t want to be doing it in the first place. But to change this system, we must push hard to change the corrupting role of money in politics. And yes, those forces exist among all parties.
Our political system’s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts, but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers’ time away from lawmaking. That’s a feature, not a flaw - the less time lawmakers have, the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions.
Instead, your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues &amp; exposing abuse of power. So while Fox continues to laugh that I’m “just a bartender,” I’ve spend the whole year studying big pharma, private equity, military contractors, and Mark Zuckerberg’s shady deals.
There is, of course, much more time for me to be fully present at my job. In Congress, this is a luxury. Since I don’t spend hours each day asking for money, I spend a lot more time legislating, studying, &amp; preparing/sitting in hearings. This has cumulative effects over time.
I intentionally built my campaign to rely on small-dollar grassroots support w/o any corporate $, because I felt that’s the best way to be accountable to everyday people. It has impacted how I work in Congress in powerful ways - ways I couldn’t fully appreciate until I got here.
While many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people &amp; the public good, in truth it’s more powerful than ever. I haven’t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars, &amp; I don’t meet w/ corp lobbyists. That is the power of your grassroots support.
Public education, libraries, &amp; infrastructure policies (which we‘ve had before in America and elsewhere in the world!) are not “free stuff.” They are PUBLIC GOODS. And they are worth investing in, protecting, &amp; advancing for all society and future generations. Sincerely, NY-14
Dance Dance Revolution! 🌺🗳
Wow, of all the people to get cancelled
In my first 11 months I’ve cosponsored 339 pieces of legislation, authored 15, took on Big Pharma w/ my colleagues in hearings that brought PreP generic a year early &amp; exposed abuse of power. In 4 years, you’ve jailed kids &amp; made corruption the cause celebré. Try to keep up.
Spent today organizing and hosting a teach-in with our public housing residents at Pelham Parkway Houses. As we wrapped up the event, I went to admire the art by children in the community hung up on the walls. This one stayed with me:

Many have told me they think the pro-justice &amp; worker provisions in the Green New Deal are “unnecessary.” Yet this example is why a just transition is vital. Without it, oil barons turn into energy barons, &amp; workers are hurt all the same. Bright Power must be held accountable.
You did! I’m getting lunch ☺️

You are correct! Luckily, I’ve introduced a bill that does just that ☺️:
Marijuana should be legalized, and drug consumption should be decriminalized. These are matters of public health.
I want to be the party of the New Deal again. The party of the Civil Rights Act, the one that electrified this nation and fights for all people. For that, many would call us radical. But we aren’t “pushing the party left,” we are bringing the party home.
We’re not done with Stephen Miller. He’s a verified White Supremacist controlling US immigration policy, which has now detained over 70,000 migrant children. This is not to be dismissed. People’s lives are at risk. He needs to go now. We’re mobilizing:
It doesn’t stop at music. For people w/ friends or family who worked in retail &amp; suddenly laid off or hours deeply cut (Toys R’ Us, Sears, Sports Authority, etc) &amp; sometimes stripped of severance, that goes back to PE as well. 1+ million jobs destroyed.
Private equity groups’ predatory practices actively hurt millions of Americans. Their leveraged buyouts have destroyed the lives of retail workers across the country, scrapping 1+ million jobs. Now they’re holding @taylorswift13’s own music hostage. They need to be reigned in.

Trump himself is clearly not satisfied with only one article of impeachment. His choice to publicly broadcast his own, personally authored witness intimidation means he’s wants to sign up for another article on obstruction of justice, too.

This is the official Congressional press list, not a supporter mailing list. Our apologies, as someone must have mistaken you for a journalist. That’ll be fixed right away.
Rep. Scalise, the only way you‘d conclude this is if you thought foreign interference is Trump‘s main strategy to win in 2020. Letting our elections be subverted by hostile actors *IS* disastrous. Now, why is the GOP blocking election protection measures in the Senate? 🤔
Call me radical, but maybe instead of setting ablaze hundreds of millions of dollars on multiple plutocratic, long-shot, very-late presidential bids, we instead invest hundreds of millions into winning majorities of state legislatures across the United States? Just a thought!
When nurses have your back, you know it’s real. ♥️ Thank you @NationalNurses and all our NNU nurses in the Bronx and Queens for this profound endorsement. Together we will win #MedicareForAll!
I love how @RepPressley is not only introducing a #JusticeGuarantee bill today, but she’s also releasing materials to educate on the *principles* upon which the guarantee is drafted. Understanding principles unlocks the why behind a legislation’s chosen approach. Here she has 5.

Donald Trump abused the power of the US government to extort Ukraine into undermining the 2020 elections. Today’s hearings put Trump’s own fingerprints all over the scene of the crime. It left no room for him to pin this on anyone else, but plenty to drag others down with him.
I thought it was cool making it to Silver... But today I found out Rep. @JoshHarder is ranked PLATINUM! 😱

I finally made it to Silver🥈😭
Stephen Miller must resign. Now. Each day we allow a white nationalist to be in charge of US immigration policy is a day where thousands of children &amp; families lives are in danger. This year alone, under Miller’s direction, the US has put almost 70,000 children in custody.
Stephen Miller, Trump’s architect of mass human rights abuses at the border (including child separation &amp; detention camps w/ child fatalities) has been exposed as a bonafide white nationalist. He’s still at the White House shaping US immigration policy. Miller must resign. Now.

The racial wealth gap is not an accident. It is the result of 100s of years of discriminatory practices+policies. A few examples: - Redlining - Mass incarceration - Hyde amendment - ‘08 crisis, where Black homeowners were disproportionately targeted for predatory subprime loans
What’s happening right now in Bolivia isn’t democracy, it’s a coup. The people of Bolivia deserve free, fair, and peaceful elections - not violent seizures of power.

It’s only when we talk about acting on climate do some ask,“how are you going to pay for it?” As though climate inaction doesn’t have a price tag. As though the Midwest didn’t flood. As though California isn’t on fire. As though 1000s didn’t die in María.
Many people are surprised to learn that I still knock doors almost everywhere I go ☺️ It’s how I get to know people &amp; communities! This morning I knocked some doors in Iowa before our @BernieSanders Climate Summit to get an understanding of how people are thinking about issues.
Hello Iowa! ☺️👋🏽
Yes 🙂
💜
Y’all, the billionaires are asking for a safe space - you know, in addition to the entire US economy and political lobbying industry.
The #GreenNewDeal works in coal country because we‘ve been fighting to fully fund coal workers’ pensions &amp; work w/ impacted communities to plan a just transition. A GND can put everyone to work without leaving anyone behind. It’s a winning message everywhere, incl Kentucky. 🌱🇺🇸
NYC: There’s still time to swing by your polling place and vote - polls close at 9pm! This year we have *5* ballot proposals, including bringing ranked choice voting to NYC! Find your polling location &amp; read up on the proposals in the thread below. Takes just a few minutes ⬇️
When it comes to the climate crisis, tweaks and shortcuts aren’t enough to preserve our planet. Massive, systemic change is in alignment with scientific consensus. We need #GreenNewDeal.
Won’t you look at that: turns out all the chicken littles on raising min wage were wrong!🐣 GOP said the sky would fall if we raised tipped wages to $15/hr w #TipsOnTop. Turns out both revenue &amp; employment are UP since the #Fightfor15,&amp; way more people are getting a fair shake.
😂
3. Head to your location and vote! Make sure you check the times because they vary. And if you don’t make it today, be sure to vote on Tuesday!
2. Find out how you’re going to vote! This year we have 5 ballot proposals, including one on RANKED CHOICE VOTING which is pretty cool. Here’s the NYT breakdown on the proposals. It includes their endorsements &amp; rationale but of course vote as you wish:
1. Find your early voting location. NOTE: It’s not the same as your regular polling location! So look it up since this is new for everyone. Find yours here:
NYC: Did you know you can VOTE EARLY today? It’s easy, I just did it, and I’ll show you how in this thread ⬇️
💡Quick Daylight Savings tip: if you worked a late shift last night when the clocks rolled back &amp; had to work an extra hour, make sure you check your paystub this week and get paid for it! Computers sometimes miss it. Make sure you get paid - don’t let your labor get stolen!
Ending mass incarceration means challenging a system that jails the poor to free the rich. Arresting people who can’t afford a $2.75 fare makes no one safer and destabilizes our community. New Yorkers know that, they’re not having it, and they’re standing up for each other.
You are correct! But you tried to extort a foreign government for personal gain, so here we are.
Being a working person in Congress makes me better at my job. I can’t tell you how many members don’t know what it’s like to be uninsured, or have to choose between rent and a prescription. GOP seem to think that being born with a fancy last name is a personal accomplishment.
Back in the Bronx for our community Halloween &amp; Harvest party! 👻🎃 Over 600 people in the neighborhood came together to dance, decorate pumpkins, &amp; share treats. (I went as industrial policy heroine Rosie the Riveter ☺️) Special thanks to @bronxboundbooks for coming through!
We did. That’s why we opened an impeachment inquiry.
I say this as a candidate that runs digital ads &amp; believe they can be productive + useful *IF* used responsibly. People say that tech companies can’t fact check, but basic fact checking isn’t hard. We‘re talking abt blocking outright disinformation: wrong vote records, etc.
Many folks have asked whether I believe all social media political ads should be banned outright. I believe that if a company cannot or does not wish to run basic fact-checking on paid political advertising, then they should not run paid political ads at all. /2
This is a good call. Technology - and social media especially - has a powerful responsibility in preserving the integrity of our elections. Not allowing for paid disinformation is one of the most basic, ethical decisions a company can make. /1
The Good News: We are hosting a kids’ Halloween/Harvest celebration party for NY-14 families tomorrow! 🎃🍂 The Bad News: I haven’t had time to put together a costume :( Any favorite last minute costume ideas out there? Help!
That’s amore 💕
Well I *am* anti-establishment 😉 jk I’ve never been
The climate crisis threatens our way of life, and we must decarbonize our economy &amp; way of life to save the planet. I wish it wasn’t such a bad situation too, but previous generations failed to act &amp; now young people need to deal w the science of our future &amp; create opportunity.
Yeah that’s kind of the point
The Squad is big!!
Courageous workers at Facebook are now standing up to the corporation’s leadership, challenging Zuckerberg’s disturbing policy on allowing paid, targeted disinformation ads in the 2020 election:
This is what climate change looks like. The GOP like to mock scientific warnings about climate change as exaggeration. But just look around: it’s already starting. We have 10 years to cut carbon emissions in half. If we don’t, scenes like this can get much worse.
Zuckerberg has been justifying Facebook’s increasingly disturbing decisions by acting like the company is some innocent, neutral bystander. But as we discover more info, that is getting harder to believe. They are making active &amp; aggressive decisions that imperil our elections.
Here’s what we know: - Zuckerberg ”doesn’t know” when he/FB discovered the Cambridge Analytica scandal. That is hard to believe. - After Zuck privately met w/ Trump &amp; far-right, he’s now allowing paid disinformation ads. - He didn’t tell the whole truth abt his “fact checkers”
Everyone sleeps on Janeway
There are several aspects to Zuckerberg’s answers on Cambridge Analytica, paid disinformation ads, &amp; Facebook’s ties to the far-right that aren’t adding up. There may be a deeper story here, and we need to get to the bottom of it - the integrity of our elections are at stake.
Progressive policies as an Ariana dance party: 👋🏽 thank u, next: Replace for-profit health insurance w/ #MedicareForAll 👩🏾 God is a Woman: Strike the Hyde Amendment 👨🏽‍🎓 Break Free: Student loan debt forgiveness 🌎 Be Alright: Pass a Green New Deal! 💃🏽🎶
Could use more avocado toast, but you’re in! 🛴🥑
“Emmett Till signs have been stolen, thrown in the river, replaced, shot, replaced again, shot again and defaced with acid.” “The defilement reflects the belief that Mississippi’s public square should be reserved for Confederate memorials &amp; other testaments to white supremacy.”
There have been many aspects of the GOP’s little flash mob that have relied on mountains of entitlement and privilege, but them *asking* the police to be arrested is just... Well, let’s just say my community would find it hard to understand why *anyone* would ask to be arrested.
Rep. Mooney, you &amp; I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses &amp; get their stories to see what adds up. You know that making these depositions public will help potential criminals line up their testimony. Why do you want to do that?
What’s worse: since many of the flash mob already sat on the committees, they *knew* how serious a breach it was to bring devices into SCIF &amp; did it anyways. Our country is a game to them. Remember that the next time they use “natl security” as an excuse for their bad ideas.
Important to remember that GOP&amp;Dem members have been part of impeachment depositions this whole time. All you need is to sit on the relevant committees. If these guys are so mad, maybe they should take their little flash mob to the @GOPLeader who didn’t assign them to the task.
Yes, asking for a friend... or 30 😉
Twitter separates your DMs into two inboxes - one from people you follow/talk to and one from strangers. So worry not! I also have the quality filter on, so that’s getting stress-tested to say the least
(That said, your question is more likely to be read if you comment instead because RIP my DMs for real. The things we do in the name of public service)
It’s me. I sift through it 😭
Many of you have commented with “DM me” - so I am opening my DMs for tonight and tomorrow for question recommendations.
Hypothetically, if you were, say, a member of Congress sitting on the Financial Services Committee given 5 minutes to question Mark Zuckerberg, what would you ask? 🤔
It is atrocious that the President would refer to one of the most horrifying, violent practices of white supremacists to pretend he is a victim of anything but his own actions. Take this moment to learn abt this dark history,&amp; why we should support the Commission on Reparations.
Looking forward to it! 💕
If you take time to get to know @JCisnerosTX, you’ll understand how important her voice would be to Congress. Back in the day I used to organize &amp;work w families in her community. This South Texas district is quite close to my heart. Check out her story:
Last year, NY-14 elected me as the youngest woman to serve in Congress. Let’s help Jessica Cisneros shatter that record in 2020. @JCisnerosTX is a powerful, progressive fighter. Her win will get us closer to a more just America. I’m proud to support her:
If ~2 years and 20+ candidates aren’t enough for ya, I don’t know what to tell you.
Of course! Grateful for what you do.
Julián is a powerful presence in this race. I’m really proud of him &amp; how he consistently uses his platform to uplift &amp; center issues that are wrongly marginalized, like homelessness+police violence. Some folks try to make primaries vicious. In truth, we’re all in this together.
Celia Cruz remains THE greatest salsera of all time. An icon. Know your history! 👑💃🏿
Fun fact: @RepKatiePorter is the bomb &amp; she’s also one of the funniest members of Congress. She’s a champion for working families &amp; bravely holds down progressive values from a swing seat, showing that it’s a winning cause. Support her if you can:
A lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in “the 1%.” That may be bc it’s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten. Even this number - $500k - reflects top income, &amp; even THAT doesn’t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth.
Thanks, @bradlander! We should all be grateful to have such strong, progressive leadership to choose from. For many it’s a tough choice precisely because of how great they are. I’m confident we will all come together on the other side stronger than ever 💪🏽💜
Hi Neera! I’m deeply thankful for Sec. Clinton’s leadership and role in the establishment of CHIP. I am also looking forward to fighting for an America that treats healthcare as a right for *all* people, regardless of their age, income, or background, with #MedicareForAll. 🇺🇸✌🏽
Today I am endorsing Senator @BernieSanders for president. In the end, we must come together to defeat Donald Trump. We should do so knowing he is a symptom of a larger problem - and our greatest hope is a multiracial, working class movement in the United States of America.
Hey all! We’re having a big ol’ NYC party tomorrow &amp; everyone’s invited. Thousands of people are RSVP’d. All are welcome. (Not sure who you’re going to support yet? That’s great! Come on in, listen to people in the movement, &amp; learn more about the future we’re fighting for.)
“Thank you for asking, bc not many people have asked if I’m ok.” Sudden prominence is a very dehumanizing experience. There’s a part of your life that you lose, &amp; it later dawns on you that you’ll never get it back. The people who treat you like a human make all the difference.
The President of the United States is using the language of ethnic cleansing. If we allow him to continue, who would he use it on next?
A devastating loss for our country. Chairman Cummings was a giant: a universally respected leader who brought profound insight, commitment, and moral fortitude to Congress. His guidance and vision was an enormous gift. I will forever cherish his example. May he rest in power.
“This president is caging kids at the border while letting ISIS go free.” @JulianCastro coming with the straight up truth.
Tax the rich.
That part ⬇️
Thank you! There are too many plans out there that seem more interested in protecting corporate profits than protecting the lives of working Americans. We need #MedicareForAll, and we need it now.
Happy birthday! 🎉🎈🎂
Both rationality &amp; emotion are inextricable to good leadership, which balances the two. If a person doesn’t feel urgency in their gut when communities are poisoned or when a young man dies bc he couldn’t afford price-gouged insulin, then they shouldn’t be in politics. At all.
It is time we trash the idea that empathy = leadership weakness. When people hurt, we should hurt too. That’s what good leaders do. It adds urgency &amp; humanity to our decision making. Suppressing emotion can lead to aggression, impulsivity, &amp; other erosions of leadership ability.
You know, maybe one of the actual problems w/ our politics is that too many politicians don’t feel anything when Americans die bc they can’t afford medicine, or when babies are permanently separated from parents. GOP only has tears for billionaires &amp; outrage towards “others.”
Trump: sexually assaults women, impulsively allows Kurds to be murdered, boosts videos of shooting journalists GOP: Aha! Letting your voice shake after seeing 1st-hand human rights violations at the border+ understanding climate stakes makes women “too emotional” for politics 🙄
Small-dollar grassroots campaigns, aka what Buttegieg insults here as “pocket change,” out-fundraise him by millions. Our nation’s leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics, not protect it. &amp; Beto’s gun policy isn’t “picking a fight,” it’s taking a stand.
¡Gracias Tío Bernie!
💜💜 thank you!
💜💜
Thank you everyone for the birthday wishes!🎈 Spending the day in Denmark after C40, enjoying this social democracy that treats healthcare &amp; education as rights, zero-carbon as priority, &amp; infrastructure as a key public good. Here’s to another year of fighting for our future.💜
This is how the powerful and the predatory are protected: by their friends and allies commanding powerful organizations; by people willing to accept their money or status in exchange for boosting their reputation; and by those too eager to look the other way.
For working people. For the poor. For jobs. For justice. For peace. For prosperity. For economic mobility. For society. For our planet. We fight for a #GreenNewDeal.
😉
(The truth is, the GOP loves spending the public’s money - but only when it’s to benefit themselves, the very wealthy, &amp; their industry friends. See: oil subsidies, the trillion-dollar GOP tax scam, etc, etc)
The real tea is that Jeff Sessions gets publicly subsidized haircuts to look as self-made as possible before telling everyone else to lift themselves up by their bootstraps. Wonder how many other Republicans do the same? 🍵🍵🍵
👀
Le plaisir est pour moi, Maire @Anne_Hidalgo!
Won’t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts’ worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses. I wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman’s cut &amp; color.
40 million Americans live in poverty under today’s extreme inequality, yet the right-wing want you to blame Democratic socialism for their own moral failures. Our policies, like Medicare for All, advance prosperity for working people. They’re just mad we look good doing it 💁🏽‍♀️
Wishing all our neighbors and loved ones observing #YomKippur an easy and meaningful fast. G'mar Chatimah Tovah.
Autocrats: “Jump!” Trump: “How high?” - Trump admin foreign policy, 2019
Trump decision isn’t about drawing down US military involvement at all. Remember that earlier this year, Trump VETOED Congress’ attempt to end US involvement in the Yemen War. He has significant personal financial conflicts of interest in this situation, among other concerns.
Federal govs are failing to act on the climate crisis. We can’t wait for others to lead. That’s why I’m in Copenhagen w/ C40 mayors, trade unions, youth climate strikers, business &amp; citizen reps from around the world to rally for a Global #GreenNewDeal.
I was in a conversation*this year* w/ many people in the room &amp;one guy asked if he could rescind a job offer if he found out a candidate was pregnant. In my early 20s I was told that if I got engaged, don’t wear the ring to interviews to better my odds. This is *present day.*
Trump’s sudden withdrawal from northern Syria &amp; endorsement of Turkey’s actions could have catastrophic consequences &amp; risks laying the ground for immense violence and suffering. We can pursue a strategy to stop our endless wars without endangering the lives of innocent people.
Correct 🎃 🍬
When Republicans say our nation‘s laws are “just a joke,” they mean it. They treat our country as a joke, our communities as a joke, and our future as a joke. For the GOP, as long as the rich get richer, they are happy to play games with American lives.
Not stingy. Broke. And low wages, poor work standards, high cost of living, &amp; a runaway student loan crisis have everything to do with it.
It’s time to look under the hood.
Lastly, people tend to say “what do you do with all the violent people?” as a defense for incarcerating millions. Our lawmaking process means we come to solutions together, &amp;either way we should work to an end where our prison system is dramatically smaller than it is today. /4
Secondly, our prison &amp; jail system is so large bc we use them as de facto mental hospitals, homeless shelters, &amp; detox centers instead of *actually* investing in... mental health, housing, edu, &amp; rehab. If we invested meaningfully, what do you think would happen to crime? /3
First of all, many people in jailed or in prison don’t belong there at all. Whether it’s punitive sentencing for marijuana possession or jailing people for their poverty &amp; letting the rich free through systems like cash bail, we wrongly incarcerate far, far too many people. /2
I know the term “prison abolition” is breaking some people’s brains. The right is already freaking out. Yet the US incarcerates more than anywhere in the world. We have more than enough room to close many of our prisons and explore just alternatives to incarceration. /1
Yesterday morning I spoke with a woman who was thrown in Rikers as a teenager. Put in solitary confinement for MONTHS, aka torture. Force-fed pills. The conditions were so bad, she too had drank out of toilets. A cage is a cage is a cage. And humans don’t belong in them.
Mass incarceration is our American reality. It is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid, &amp; slavery. To end it, we have to change. That means we need to have a real conversation about decarceration &amp; prison abolition in this country.
Even billionaires are saying billionaires shouldn’t exist. I wonder if extreme-wealth worshippers will listen to the point now that those with extreme wealth are saying it, too?
(I love how GOP pundits are already saying “it’s not enough to pay for it!” even though “it” isn’t even defined in the tweet 😉 It’s almost as if regardless of the circumstance, the GOP take is: “Whatever you’re talking about, don’t tax the rich - no matter what!”)
Hey everyone, I think I figured out how we’re going to pay for it ⬇️
Since the Trump admin is hamstringing the Census, we’re stepping in ourselves. Our organizing must go beyond elections. If you have friends or family intimidated about answering next year’s Census, start talking to them NOW. The stakes are way too high.
Just when we caught a glimpse of justice for Botham Jean, much of it feels stolen back with the murder of Joshua Brown, a key witness in the case. My heart breaks for his family and for everyone touched by this tragedy. We must get to the bottom of this injustice.
If the Trump administration is so confident about their coverup, then why are they hiding?
The United States doesn’t even offer guaranteed healthcare for *its own citizens,* yet wants to demand it from people of other national origins. Hypocrisy, xenophobia, and barbarism all in one policy.
It’s wrong. It’s harmful. And his bigotry is reflective of the white supremacist base he relies on for political gain.
Understand that Trump is engaged in deliberate, atrocious, targeted antisemitism towards Chairman Schiff. Then ask yourself why no one cares to denounce it - esp when his accusation of it towards others drove full news cycles earlier this year.
To clarify on that ratio: Annually, we spend about $17,500 per child on education; and ~$250k-300k per person we incarcerate.
Hey Suzie! Thanks for your question. Comptroller reported this yr that “the city’s annual cost per inmate ballooned to $302,296 — up from $275,986 the previous year.” Conservatively, we spend 14x more to incarcerate each person than to educate each child:
With respect to the betrayal of our country, it doesn’t matter much how these aides felt. History will judge them by what they did. And the answer is nothing.
😂😂😂
Nobody reacted to this lady because this is New York City and Trump plants are amateurs compared to what we deal with on the NYC subway system 🚊
Well, that’s that on that. No wonder Pompeo tried to block release of these records. It documents it all right here.
Turns out the woman yelling was a Trump supporter 🤷🏽‍♀️ Doesn’t rule out potential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis. Earlier this year I was stalked &amp; very nearly hurt by a disturbed person. I don’t take chances &amp; immediately try to de-escalate.
Better than being a criminal who betrays our country.
In the words of @AyannaPressley: #ChangeCantWait!
Haha, sorry to expose you to all that! RT’s have their upsides and downsides. I’m quite alright thank you, maybe don’t check your mentions for a bit 🙃
Want to check out tonight’s town hall? Check it out here! ⬇️📺
This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.
Yes, I prepare powerpoints for my constituents at town halls 🤓
Hey everyone! We had a fabulous town hall tonight &amp; I’ll be highlighting some moments from it. At one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis &amp; want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately. Let’s not mock or make a spectacle. &amp;let’s work on Medicare for All!
Kudos!
Our monthly town hall is tonight! We’re answering questions, &amp; updating everyone on our Just Society suite of bills &amp; more. RSVPs are already maxed out to constituents, but you can tune in online via CSPAN ⬇️
Wow. Congratulations to the California grassroots for this enormous victory. Kudos to @GavinNewsom for signing this. Public banking is next level!
So apparently at Fox News you can parrot a wide range of conspiracy theories &amp; falsely claim white supremacy is a “hoax,” but saying this gets you fired? I’m just trying to figure out where the line is 🤷🏽‍♀️ After all, how was he supposed to know this was below their standards?
🤣 you’ll have to shave the beard hermano!
You’re in, @FullFrontalSamB! 😉
Sending lots of love and solidarity to @BernieSanders today as he rests and recovers. A lot of people don’t understand how crazy hard grassroots campaigning is - for organizers and candidates alike. Rest up, friend. We’re with you!
Thank YOU! Inspired by your diligent, committed, hard-working &amp; tenacious students. What a humbling video &amp; thanks for thinking of me during #LatinxHeritageMonth. Keep at it and aim high!
As dire as things can be, it’s important to show how mass mobilization is still winning in very big ways through public pressure and organizing. For-profit prison &amp; detention co’s are running dry. Banks see them as too much of a public liability &amp; are no longer financing them ⬇️
“Billionaires should not exist” does not mean certain people should not exist. It means no person should have a billion dollars. The ascent of billionaires is a symptom &amp; outcome of an immoral system that tells people affordable insulin is impossible but exploitation is fine.
The cruelty has always been the point.
Well dang
Zuckerberg himself said: “If someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat+fight.” Well, Facebook’s reckless behavior represents a threat to our privacy &amp; American democracy. Some things are worth fighting for. So let’s go to the mat &amp; fight.
“Struggling” 🤣 with what? Math?
“If another country came in here, blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we’d go to war. But industry can.” - Paula Jean Swearengin
We stand for the basic human dignity of Kashmiris &amp; support democracy, equality, and human rights for all - including the most vulnerable. Reports of violence &amp; torture are extremely concerning, and the blockade from communication and life-saving medical care must end.
It’s wild to me how people crawled over my 60 mins interview with a fine-toothed comb to find any word or reason to claim I’m unfit for the job, yet here Kevin McCarthy (the GOP Leader!) is a bumbling, sloppy, dishonest mess &amp; his mediocrity is accepted as a matter of course.
On October 8th, Aimee Stephens &amp; the @ACLU will bring the first trans civil rights case ever heard by the US Supreme Court. Thank you, Aimee - for your courage to fight for civil rights and the dignity of all people in our country.
One of the major reasons we don’t talk about debt &amp; poverty is shame. Yet way more Americans are living in poverty than our country wants to admit. It’s time we stop looking the other way on economic abuse, like predatory lending, abusive workplaces, &amp; extortionary landlords.
It’s an honor of a lifetime to join members of Congress who have been taking the hard road &amp; fighting for justice their whole lives. Barbara Lee is one of them. Thank you, @RepBarbaraLee for leading the fight in reproductive justice to end the Hyde Amendment. #BeBoldEndHyde ✨
I truly can think of few things less patriotic, more cowardly, and plainly pathetic + reckless than amplifying calls for civil war within your own country. This President has never been interested in leading. He‘s interested in consolidating power with a cult of personality.
Jackson Heights never fails! We were successful in our Momo hunting last night. I had the Mokthuk at Lhasa Fast Food 🥘🥟
That soundtrack tho 🕺🏽🎳 🎶
👋🏽
Thanks!
Trump Tower used as a piggy bank was enough. 10 incidents of obstruction of justice was enough. Permanently separating children &amp; parents for profit was enough. Detention camps were enough. Muslim ban was enough. Trans servicemember ban was enough. Ukraine is beyond enough.
Shana Tovah to our neighbors and family in NY-14 and across the world! 🍎🍯 Here’s to a happy and sweet new year for all.
Thank you, @JulianCastro!
For months &amp; years, these women endured criticism &amp; death threats for telling the truth. Yet they still tried to stop blatant corruption as it got worse: diplomats staying at Trump properties, kids dying in for-profit prisons who gave $ to his inaugural cmte, obstr of justice.
Today I’m showing some love to @RepMaxineWaters + @RashidaTlaib, who endured the brunt of gaslighting &amp; vitriol for being among the first to recognize WH corruption &amp; publicly advocate for impeachment, making it easier for the rest of us. People think that’s easy. It’s not.
🔥🔥🔥
To be honest, it should really be @AyannaPressley plus 3 since she is *easily* the best singer out of all of us. I’m just the one holding the wind fan 🌬
This is beyond partisanship. It is a heartbreaking betrayal of our nation. The President and everyone involved in this should resign immediately.
“If it’s a secret, I’ll vote for it.” For a party that brands itself on being so tough, they sure run around DC like a bunch of cowards.
Not only must Native voices not be ignored, they should be *centered* in a climate agenda. Indigenous wisdom, principles, &amp; organizing have been proven right on climate over and over. Listen (&amp; learn! @RepDebHaaland + @sharicedavids are the US’ first Native Congresswomen)
No matter your politics, the idea of *anyone* (let alone a man!) intimidating Speaker Pelosi is laughable. Congress was &gt;80% male when she became speaker. Kellyanne Conway is running out of excuses. Perhaps that’s why she’s been running away from our Oversight subpoenas. 💅🏽🧾
NYC taxi drivers were trapped in a predatory lending scheme for taxi medallions. Drivers, many of them immigrants, were piled on w/ million-dollar loans on incomes of $~20k/year. It’s led to a suicide crisis. They need to be bailed out &amp; those responsible need to answer for it.
I love how McConnell is saying “since you’re impeaching, NOW we’re not going to pass bills.” What does he mean, now? Mitch McConnell hasn’t done a damn thing all year. He literally brags that his office is a graveyard. We passed gun safety in Feb &amp; he STILL hasn’t held a vote.
Then why did you confess to it?
There is almost no excuse for a member of Congress to have not read the whistleblower report by now. It’s a few pages. This is literally our jobs. If you don’t have the commitment to be here and do the work, cut your fancy fundraisers &amp; make the time, or quit. cc: @SenateGOP
NY’s party registration date has been moved from October to Valentine’s Day! This gives NYers MONTHS more time to register to vote in primary elections 🗳 There’s more to do, like same-day reg &amp; open primaries. Congrats to all the activists + organizers for this major win 👏🏽👏🏽
Yo, @NRA - you seemed to have had a lot of time yesterday waiting outside my office and making videos about me. Yet you‘re suddenly so quiet &amp; pressed about answering my question. Are you scared or just punking out? Release the raw video.
The full whistleblower complaint has been declassified for the public. Read it yourself - it’s extremely disturbing. It discusses the President using the power of the US gov to extort foreign govs into 2020 political probes, &amp; WH attempts to cover it up.
Hey @NRA, why don’t you release my full, unedited interview? You know, the one where my first answer to your question was “Aren’t y’all broke?” I think the public would like to see it in full. Releasing it is the right move - unless of course you think it’ll make you look bad.
I wish they’d release the tape of the full interview. My first response to them was “Aren’t y’all broke?” 😂
Thank you!!
A progressive agenda is a winning agenda. 📊✅
Thank you! 💪🏽🌹
“It is not responsible to complain about anything we dislike as ‘socialism,’ particularly when many of my colleagues across the aisle are more than happy to support billions of dollars in government subsidies + carveouts for oil, gas, &amp; fossil fuel industries.” Bye, @HouseGOP 👋🏽
Also - what they are calling a “transcript” isn’t even a transcript. It’s a collection of notes. This is what they are *admitting* to and it’s way above and beyond what is necessary for impeachment. The President engaged in an outright betrayal of our country.
"I would like you to do us a favor...” Folks, I am surprised the White House even released this transcript. It’s worse than we thought. The President sought to use the powers of the United States government to investigate a political opponent. We have no choice but to impeach.
Did you know our Fed poverty line is based on 1955 spending, &amp; the way we calculate it hasn’t changed since 1964? It assumes 1 earner &amp; a mother home full-time. It doesn’t include cost of childcare, geographic cost of living, or healthcare. Some predict it should be *$38k/yr.*
Big day! We’re rolling out our next major project: A Just Society. It’s a 6-piece suite: 1. Recognizing Poverty Act 2. Place to Prosper Act 3. Mercy in Re-Entry Act 4. Embrace Act 5. Uplift Our Workers Act 6. Ratify the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, &amp; Cultural Rights ⬇️
Eight. Dollars.
Policy drop tomorrow 📝 Because while we must hold this administration accountable in the short term, We also need to propose solutions that help heal profound systems of economic injustice for the long term.
When it comes to climate change, we are going to pay no matter what. The question is: will we pay (more) to react and contribute to destruction, or will we pay to proactively defend and preserve future generations? Look around &amp; read the science. That is the question before us.
This is a huge deal: one of the first major political party adoptions of a #GreenNewDeal as an official policy plank. Our future relies on whether our leaders choose to act now. Thank you @UKLabour and all people in the movement for leading the world with ACTION. 🌹🌎
Remember: the work to save our democracy is deeper than the Q of Trump. We must fix the deeply rooted, broken systems that enabled this crisis in our democracy in the 1st place. In addition to impeachment, we must also pursue long-term changes to keep this from happening again.
Yes, this is an emergency. We don’t have the luxury of time w/ another committee. Judiciary has been investigating&amp; putting the pieces together for months. Impeachment belongs there. We must honor jurisdiction, historical precedent,&amp; work done + allow Judiciary to move forward.
This is what authoritarians do.
Big thanks to Rep. @JoeNeguse and the local Unitarian ministry who introduced me to Ingrid and her family, and have been fighting hard for her freedom. 💪🏽💜
Last week, Ingrid Latorre gave birth inside a Colorado church where the local faith community is protecting her. We met in the church rec room where she went into labor. If we had a functioning immigration system w/ real paths to citizenship, we wouldn’t have to live like this.

Anything less than a solution on the scale of the crisis is a form of climate denial. It’s time for #GenerationGND. 🌍
White supremacy is a fundamentally violent ideology that’s been growing at an alarming rate, fueling one mass shooting after another. It’s about time we recognized white nationalism for the major terrorist threat that it is.
When the public democratically decides to invest in ourselves, in working people, they call it socialism. When a billionaire-captured government forces the public to pay for their misdeeds at the expense of working people, they just call it the cost of capitalism.
“In many ways, the climate crisis is a product, it’s an externality, of our unsustainable way of life, &amp; you don’t fix that with a solar panel, You fix it by changing the way we think &amp; operate as a society. We‘ve done it before, &amp; can do it again.” Thanks for having me, Joe!
It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law. It’s another to let him. The integrity of our democracy isn’t threatened when a president breaks the law. It‘s threatened when we do nothing about it. The GOP’s silence &amp; refusal to act shouldn’t be a surprise. Ours is.
At this point, the bigger national scandal isn’t the president’s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party’s refusal to impeach him for it.
We are being invited into people’s homes. One woman just showed me her recent blood test, which is sky-high in benzene levels. I’m told many others are the same. Oil and gas co’s are going in hard to lobby+dominate local govs. But the community is organizing to fight back.
I’m in Colorado w/ @JoeNeguse visiting communities whose air is being poisoned by fracking. What we’re seeing is appalling. Companies are building fracking sites on public lands, across the street from schools + homes. Their toxic emissions are invisible. This camera sees them.
Boulder brought the house down this morning! Big thanks to all the Coloradoans who joined @JoeNeguse and I for a powerful #GreenNewDeal conversation ✨
Yes, which is another item being tested for larger rollout soon 😉
I am currently in Colorado to visit families impacted by fracking sites and to cohost a #GreenNewDeal town hall with Rep. @JoeNeguse. This is our first trip testing innovative approaches to childcare policies. We’re hoping to learn from it &amp; refine for future trips/ideas 🍼
The tot is my staffer’s 1 y/o! I was on holding duty for this stretch of the trip ✈️👶🏽 We are testing new childcare policies on the campaign by covering childcare expenses for traveling parents, or covering travel for children + a partner to join on certain trips. Wish us luck!
Immensely proud of the movement today 🌎
(Certain localities and municipalities did pursue abolition earlier, but none were federally recognized.)
The right is pushing back on this. To clarify in 280 chars, DC was the first area where enslaved people were freed by the US government. It was enacted by the Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862.
I cannot tell you how powerful young people mobilizing their parents &amp; grandparents are in changing the game on issues &amp; elections. We did this last yr &amp; continue to now. It’s twofold organizing: it expands the electorate and flips voters. It takes multiple convos. Start now!
Incredible.
Happy birthday! 🎊
DC was the 1st territory in the United States to free the enslaved. It’s where Black Americans fled the tyranny of slavery &amp; towards greater freedom, to DC. Yet today it’s where 2nd class citizenship reigns, and the right to vote is denied. It’s time to recognize DC statehood.
Y aquí tratando en Español y Spanglish (fue un poquito difícil 🥵 ¡perdón!)
Today was Puerto Rico Advocacy Day in DC 🇵🇷 Here’s what we’re fighting for: 1. Full audit of Puerto Rico’s debt 2. Cancellation of PR’s debt 3. End La Junta and establish oversight accountable to the people 4. A #GreenNewDeal to rebuild PR
There will always be powerful interest in promoting the idea that the left is losing power 1 way or another. The big way they try to dismantle the left isn’t to attack it, but to gaslight &amp; deflate it. Dripping condescension that I’m being “educated” should be a big red flag 🙄
And just like that 🌿 10,000 farmers + ranchers have come out urging Congress to support a #GreenNewDeal. From regenerative agriculture + carbon farming to keeping our land hospitable to life, farmers &amp; ranchers know they are key to leading a Green New Deal &amp; #JustTransition.
😭 For everyone who feels confused about how to act in 2019, #GenGND is a great example for the world.
This is straight barbarism. GM workers are asking for a raise during a time of record profits. In response, GM execs cut off their health insurance. Yet another reason we insist on #MedicareforAll: so your healthcare won’t be held hostage to negotiate lower wages.
In America, people aren’t paid a living wage, healthcare isn’t guaranteed, and educating yourself to skill up will likely put you thousands of dollars in debt. Tip. If you want to change that, tip and join the progressive movement. See you in the streets. ✌🏽💸
What great news! Shout out to all our non-binary fam in the world, and the activists who’ve worked hard to let us celebrate the full spectrum of humanity 🏳️‍🌈
Republicans only seem to believe in “states rights” when it comes to denying people freedom and advancing their personal agenda.
Highlight of my day!
This is a real quote from a Democrat representing a safe blue seat. Aggressive statements like these are so casually thrown from corporate candidates towards grassroots ones, yet they never get branded as “divisive,” despite their rhetoric. We should ask ourselves why that is.
Whoomp! (There It Is)
Marie Newman (@Marie4Congress) is a grassroots fighter for working families in #IL03. To me, choosing to support is about more than just policy. It’s also about who puts in the WORK. Are they wearing out their shoes? Marie is. Her supporters are. Let’s knock doors &amp; join them.
It’s going to take a bigger, stronger Democratic Party - one that’s returned to our FDR roots &amp; fights for working people - to change our future in 2020. We can’t afford deep blue seats fighting against healthcare &amp; equal rights. We need @Marie4Congress.
Congratulations! 🇺🇸 🎈
Remember when we said climate change would cause mass migration, &amp; the right called us crazy? Well, it’s happening. And walling ourselves off from the world isn’t a plan for our future. It’s time to recognize climate refugees in our immigration policies.
Incredibly inspired by GM’s almost 50,000 workers for having the courage to strike for the dignified work they deserve. In a time of record profits, workers should prosper, not suffer. That’s why unions play a key role in an economy that works for everyone. Solidarity w/@UAW🌹
The idea of liberty and justice for all has been a radical notion since America’s founding. And as patriots, we will keep pushing until the vision of America is the reality of America. 🇺🇸
This was almost a year ago. It is unsurprising that Kavanaugh, credibly accused of sexual assault, would lie under oath to secure a Supreme Court seat. Because sexual assault isn’t a crime of passion - it’s about the abuse of power. He must be impeached.
Your ability to get insulin or see a doctor shouldn’t depend on how generous a billionaire is feeling today. Employers stripping healthcare, either by taking it away or worsening it, is just part of the casual dehumanization of working people to increase returns for the rich.
This is why corporate “choice” health plans are unacceptable, and why we must fight for #MedicareforAll. Choice plans are merely a “choice” of which corporation profits off our crisis. Healthcare is a right. It’s unconscionable that insurance companies choose who lives &amp; dies.
It is disappointing to see many pundits obsessing over whether one candidate was deferential enough to another, while this crucial moment is barely being discussed. “Civility” is too often used as a dog whistle for tone policing, while concerning moments like these get a pass.
This is a big deal: @NYCSchools is standing in solidarity with the global #ClimateStrike next Friday by excusing absences w/ parental consent. Thank you, NYC Public Schools! 🏫🌎 Come make friends, join the strike, &amp; sign up to march w/ Team AOC on 9/20:
We have to do more than take back the WH. We must do so w/ a stronger Democratic Party that fights for working people - &amp; that includes newcomers+longtime fighters. I’m proud to endorse my #GreenNewDeal co-author + climate champion @EdMarkey for Senate.
And we-oop 👀: “Comparison of the Dem’s ideology to that of the genocidal Cambodian regime is strongly ahistorical. In fact, the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge was facilitated by a Republican president, Richard Nixon, and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger.”
And guess what: if you also believe in a free + open democratic society, where people are treated humanely and don’t die over $300 insulin or needless war, they’ll call you a communist too. Well, they don’t scare us or shake our focus. We are going to build a better world.
Since the GOP will only get worse in their hysteria, let’s remember who we are: We are fighting to guarantee healthcare in America. To make education and housing dignified and accessible. To save our planet. To set living wages. To establish justice at home, &amp; peace abroad. /1
GOP’s message: No policy, no facts, just displays of violence + corporations like @ABCNetwork &amp; Sinclair who amplify them. They profit from burning my likeness on TV. But who pays for heightened security? Who answers the phones for the threats resulting from a violent, false ad?
To clarify: Rahm Emanuel once mailed the body of a dead, decomposing fish to bully a Dem he disliked. Then, as a mayor of Chicago, he worked to hide footage of the murder of Laquan McDonald from the public. Now he’s an investment banker &amp; on TV. And all this is seen as normal.
Know that this wasn’t an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP’s white supremacist case.
Republicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren’t racist. Life is weird!
Journalists could notes from @jorgeramosnews in the #DemDebate. He is asking tough, but fair questions - not to stir drama or seek a gotcha moment - but to hold people accountable to their records and have them answer for it. His clarity makes it thrilling nonetheless.
Weapons of war, specifically designed to kill human beings en masse, should not be available for purchase.
Systemic racism is a root ideology that propped up an extractive economic system that prioritizes profit over human &amp; environmental considerations. The injustices of slavery evolved into Jim Crow, redlining, the War on Drugs, mass incarceration, &amp; beyond:
There are certain industries whose lobbying power is bipartisan. Big pharma &amp; private insurance are huge ones. Their lobbyist influence is rife in Washington and in elections. Know that.
Medicare for All is the best healthcare plan for working and middle class Americans. It guarantees critical healthcare, like insulin treatments, as a right, &amp; at a lower cost too. Corporate choice plans virtually guarantee profits for insurers, not healthcare for Americans.
🔨💥
Obviously Bolton leaving is good - it was an enormous mistake to appoint him in the first place. One doesn’t need to boost authoritarians to make the point.
That’s it. That’s the headline
Today my thoughts are with 9/11 families - and in our community, the loved ones of Queens hero Det. Luis Alvarez. Just this year, Det. Alvarez testified before Congress for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund before succumbing to cancer from Ground Zero.
When people chastise millennials for not having or delaying starting their families after growing up in a recession, here’s one big reason why:
🥰
Too often, elite institutions &amp; corrupt people/orgs have a symbiotic relationship: they launder each other’s reputations for the illusion of legitimacy &amp; prestige. In this instance,leaders at MIT’s Media Lab knowingly buffed the reputation of a child rapist bc he paid for it.
Remember when Fox News made the grave mistake of actually telling people what we’re fighting for? Ah, memories.
Rent has gotten to extortion-level highs in New York City, and there’s a whole lot of lawbreaking that happens because so many working people are on the brink. Housing is a right. NY’s rent laws must be enforced if abusive, predatory actors are breaking them.
I’m going to start tailoring talking points to see what we can get them to drink out of next 🤣
The President is corrupt and must be impeached.
As we hammer away at climate deniers, the fossil fuel industry is pivoting to promote bogus climate policies. You better believe they’ll be dumping cash to lobby ALL members of Congress - not just their bread &amp; butter Republicans. Learn about how they’re working it here ⬇️
The GOP is continuing their crusade against democracy. They’re so scared that Trump will lose that they’re moving to cancel their own primaries. While the GOP screams that we’re “elitists” for wanting healthcare, they’re handing over party control to lobbyists + rich families.
(Several Dem members have introduced bills to work on issue - @RepSeanMaloney, @tedlieu, &amp; @PattyMurray have all taken swings at defunding and labeling Conversion therapy as fraud):
Conversion “therapy” isn’t therapy at all. It’s a homophobic + dangerous practice that hurts LGBTQ+ people and families. CT is banned in 18 states. We should ban it nationwide. (PS: that one of its founders was gay is a glimpse into how homophobia and toxic masculinity works)
Trump is taking away middle schools from military families, robbing disaster relief from hardest-hit communities,&amp; chopping up people’s property via eminent domain for his little wall. This is a project driven by ego - not a desire to serve and improve the lives of human beings.
I’m really proud of this interview! Growing up, Spanish was my first language - but like many 1st generation Latinx Americans, I have to continuously work at it &amp; improve. It’s not perfect, but the only way we improve our language skills is through public practice.
🎸🎸🎸
We are part of a global community. To combat the climate crisis, we must come together as a nation AND a planet. The good news: We don’t have to wait. We can start now, from the bottom up. Cities are creating jobs&amp; advancing justice w/ a #GreenNewDeal, as global mvmts mobilize.
There is no reason any person in America should pay more than 15% interest. A 15% rate is already very high. We used to ban 8+%. Usury is a shakedown of working people that should be illegal. If you agree,contact your member&amp; ask them to sign onto the Loan Shark Prevention Act.
She’s right. We all want to, &amp; can, do our part w climate change &amp; environmental justice. But know that just 3 industries are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions. &amp; if you’re concerned abt money in politics, the fossil fuel industry is a key source of political corruption.
There is a genre of videos where GOP House members - who clearly didn’t read sworn testimony that detention sinks were broken- filming themselves drinking out of toilet sinks. They’re so anti-immigrant they risk pink eye to show off that they didn’t do the reading
We need to organize around the Census, and we need to start now. This morning we were out bright and early catching AM commuters in Corona and share info on #Census2020 🌞 Census is hiring now - and we need NYC organizers! Check it out:
One of my constituents sweetly framed a clipping from our healthcare town hall in City Island and recently gave it to me. I was looking at it today and realized we had a very cool attendee in our midst the whole time 😂🧢
Domestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus, domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence. That’s why “vouching for friend” isn’t a substitute for a background check. You wouldn’t lend a car to someone w/o a license.Why lend a gun to someone w/o a background check?
Rapists can have Ivy League degrees. Abusers can look like “good dads” or have high incomes or “great jobs.” Good appearances are often a cover for abusers. In fact, many abusers RELY on their public reputation to intimidate partners from leaving (ex: “no one will believe you.”)
This idea of “I know the guy, there’s no way he beats his wife” as the way we keep guns out of the hands of abusers is ridiculous. Any person who has been abused, assaulted, etc knows that abusers often present as “upstanding.” There’s no way you’d know. That’s why it’s common.
Herein lies an important point abt domestic abuse: most of it is hidden. You could know an abuser &amp; have no clue. I’ve had friends come out to me as victims. It’s not obvious. Unsafe relationships are COMMON. That’s why House Dems passed closing the boyfriend loophole in VAWA.
You said w/ universal background checks, you wouldn’t be able to “lend” guns to friends. If a background check would be a problem, then you shouldn’t “lend” a gun. And btw, NY is one of the safest states in the country when it comes to guns, incl rural areas. Try to keep up.
You are a member of Congress. Why are you “lending” guns to people unsupervised who can’t pass a basic background check? The people you’re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, &amp; you may not know it. Why on earth would you do that?
This is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first. I can already hear climate deniers screeching: “It’s always been like this! You’re dim,” etc. No. This is about science &amp; leadership. We either decarbonize&amp;cut emissions, or we don’t &amp; let people die.
Beyond the moral wrong, racism is a powerful political tool used to dismantle public goods &amp; civil rights. So long as bigoted sympathies exist (subtly or loud), they will be used. That’s why convincing people racism is a sidenote,&amp;not broad or institutional, is a strategic move.
The corruption of Trump - of many admins - wouldn’t be politically possible without relying on sympathy for racist policies. That’s what Reagan’s Black “welfare queen” was all about, too. If people think they’re “paying for someone else,” they’ll dismantle their own healthcare.
For example: By rallying support for super racist immigration policies, (Muslim Ban, concentration camps,etc), supporters look the other way at the billions of public dollars going to private prison CEOs - who then kick some that 💰 back to Trump (ex. his inaugural committee) /3
Since corruption isn’t popular policy, racism works as the cover for the con. That’s why addressing racism isn’t a “distraction” - it’s key to understanding the hustle against working people. Culturally, racism is used as the unspoken cudgel against pro-working class policy. /2
Virtually every policy Trump pursues works to steal public money &amp; personally enrich himself &amp; his friends. 💰Gutting National Monuments pays ➡️ Fossil Fuel CEOs 💰Border concentration camps pay ➡️ Private Prison CEOs 💰Betsy DeVos pays ➡️ loan sharks It’s always about the con.
If people were actually concerned about undocumented people, the clear solution would be to offer documentation. It’s safer &amp; secure for everyone. But there is no “law &amp; order” in an immigration system of sheer chaos, where rules change every day for the sole goal of exclusion.
About 1/2 of all the cases I see at work are immigration related. Many are people who‘ve been on the path to citizenship for years. Steps that are supposed to be ~30 days are taking up to a year. Some, like work authorizations, are so delayed they’re forcing people out of jobs.
Some anti-immigrant folks like to say: “We’re not against immigration, we’re against “illegal” immigration.” If that were true, then we would make documented immigration easy &amp; safe. But each &amp; every day, this administration is grinding legal, documented immigration to a halt.
I’d love that!💄💋💕
Wow. What a moment. These two women, @Naomi_Osaka_ &amp; @CocoGauff, set an example for the world last night. This is what it’s all about.
“The retro posters nudge viewers to recall that big, federal-government-led plans have a long history in the U.S... The Civilian Conservation Corps, for example, enrolled a total of 3 million young men who helped manage forests, control soil erosion, and prevent floods”
One way to support the local LGBTQ community impacted by Boston’s white supremacist parade? Contribute to the Bail Fund for the activists who put themselves on the line protecting the Boston community: (Any $ left over goes to @MassBailFund+@Boston_GLASS)
For men who are allegedly so “proud” of being straight, they seem to show real incompetence at attracting women to their event. Seems more like a “I-Struggle-With-Masculinity” parade to me. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Hope they grow enough over the next year to support / join LGBTQ fam next #Pride! 🏳️‍🌈
Tell them, Greta. When people try to mock you personally instead of engaging the substance of your advocacy, it’s because they know how powerful you are, and that the truth is on your side. Keep inspiring and organizing. We’re going to save the planet. All of us, together. 🌎
Nope.
Here’s one of our backpack celebrations at the Bronx Park East Block Party in Allerton 🎒
Today we’re getting all our NY-14 children ready for back-to-school by providing backpacks and school supplies at local parks &amp; block parties! Tucked inside our backpacks was a special note from me to all our students for the upcoming school year:
Our #GreenNewDeal posters are inspired by the original New Deal, updated for our future. During the New Deal, FDR launched Federal One, a US project that employed 5,300 artists that created &amp; taught art to envision America’s future. Left, #TeamAOC; right, original US New Deal
Bronx &amp; Queens art is where we’re starting, but we aspire to release custom #GreenNewDeal art for local communities across America. We are also working on a line of GND reusables! The first 250 prints will be released at Family Nature Day tomorrow, where we’re doing park tours:
These posters push us to imagine our future with a Green New Deal in two of our beloved NY-14 parks: Pelham Bay &amp; Flushing Meadows. All our #GND posters are made in the US, union-printed &amp; will be available for purchase soon, but available at organizing events now. /2
Surprise!✨I am thrilled to announce the launch of our #GreenNewDeal art series with custom Bronx &amp; Queens GND posters. The Bronx edition poster will be given for free as a limited release to the public at our Pelham Bay Nature Day &amp; Backpack Giveaway in the Bronx tomorrow. /1

See? You’re a neo-Nazi fan favorite and I don’t block you for defending white supremacist viewpoints and mocking gun violence survivors.
People are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they’d like. They do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse. ✌🏽
1. I have 5.2 million followers. Less than 20 accounts are blocked for ongoing harassment. 0 are my constituents. 2. Harassment is not a viewpoint. Some accounts, like the Daily Caller, posted fake nude photos of me &amp; abused my comments to spread it. No one is entitled to abuse.
I love everything about this GOP attack ad. Republicans underestimate my intelligence bc I invite people into my home &amp; talk about policy in plain English instead of DC jargon. They think that’s dumb, so they end up paying for ads that spread &amp; explain our policy positions. 🤣
Fmr officials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It’s an abuse of power + a stain on public service. I don’t care if it’s a Democrat doing it (both parties do). In fact, that makes it worse - we’re supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them.
The “old-fashioned red-baiting approach, familiar to those of us who lived through the Cold War, doesn’t seem to be working.” Drumming fear around socialism is the GOP’s big play, &amp; it’s failing, bc capitalism = GoFundMe as our national healthcare system.
🔥🔥🔥 bye bye, @ALGOP
3,000 Americans died on your watch. You’re not the best thing to happen to anybody but yourself. And even that’s questionable.
Welcome, Greta! We are so proud of you!
If there‘s any CEO in the country that I’d be honored to go toe to toe with,the CEO of the largest for-profit private prison corporation would definitely be up there. Guess what, @GEOGroup: your entire business - the caging of humans for profit - is immoral &amp; should be outlawed.
He’s tilting at windmills. Not wind turbines - windmills. Don Quixote has entered the G7 chat.
(For real though, it is pretty concerning that this guy abused his position to try to get someone fired over something so insignificant - esp after creating a career defending vile language as a sacred freedom &amp; deriding people organizing for basic human dignity as “snowflakes.”)
Imagine being on Twitter and having the worst thing you’re called in a given day is “bedbug.” My own friends roast me harder than that 😂
Well, it’s official: Republicans are now arguing that the US isn’t (&amp; shouldn’t be) a democracy. This is what they believe. From lobbyists writing their bills to sabotaging our civil rights, the GOP works to end democracy. In reality, we have to grow it.
I’m so glad the President and I agree that the Electoral College has got to go.
Getting back home after taking a few days‘ road trip - including our National Parks! 🏞 At @SequoiaKingsNPS, anyone can preside over the House 😉 We all should fight to protect the land, *and* so every American can have the ample, necessary time off to recuperate &amp; enjoy it.
A new day, a new friend 🐧✨
5) The Electoral College isn’t about fairness at all; it’s about empowering some voters over others. Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from. The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. &amp; GOP will do everything they can to fight it.
4) We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don’t.
3) LASTLY, this concept that the Electoral College is provides “fairness” to rural Americans over coastal states doesn’t hold any water whatsoever. First of all, virtually every state has rural communities. NY. California. Much of our states are rural. But very importantly...
2) This common claim about “if we don’t have the Electoral College then a handful of states will determine the presidency” is BS. a. It’s the *EC itself* that breaks down power by state, pop vote decentralizes it b. The EC makes it so a handful of states DO determine elections
I see Fox News is big mad about abolishing the electoral college. So let’s talk about it. 1) If the GOP were the “silent majority” they claim, they wouldn’t be so scared of a popular vote. They *know* they aren’t the majority. They rely on establishing minority rule for power.
😂
So powerful.
Folks may want to read extra deep into this, but I say this simply to acknowledge the courage it takes to make a statement like this. From Warren to Castro to Bernie &amp; others, we are lucky to have the leadership bench we have right now. We should praise all their great moments!
One thing that is completely undeniable about Bernie Sanders is the enormous political courage he consistently wields on behalf of others. This statement is a big deal. He’s not just standing up for two members - he’s standing for the integrity of the entire US Congress.
😂
Netanyahu’s discriminatory decision to ban members of Congress from Israel harms int’l diplomacy. Visiting Israel &amp; Palestine are key experiences towards a path to peace. Sadly, I cannot move forward w scheduling any visits to Israel until all members of Congress are allowed.
MoC are frequently asked to visit Israel to “see things for ourselves.” But Netanyahu choosing to ban the only 2 Muslim women in Congress from entering tells the US that only *some* Americans are welcome to Israel, not all. Trump is exporting his bigotry &amp;making matters worse.
It’s clear that Rep. King must resign, but as Sen. Schatz points out, King’s endorsement is valued in the Republican Party. He can resign, but his views clearly resonate with the GOP.
King’s comment is rooted in the belief that rape is a legitimate form of sex, as is sex that’s forced or coerced through subjugation &amp; control. It’s relevant that King says this while defending his anti-choice bill restricting abortion, which seeks to control anyone w/ a uterus.
1. This is false. You must meet ALL of Lilly’s requirements. Making &lt;$50k is one of many. 2. Why should a corporation’s sense of charity determine whether you live or die? 3. Insulin patent was sold for $1 for the explicit purpose of it being not-for-profit medication for *ALL*
are due to**
One of the most manipulative tactics plutocrats use is convincing people that the systemic issues we face are a character flaws instead of policy flaws. Working people aren’t dumb or inferior; nor are they why insulin costs $300 or huge co’s pay starvation wages. Corruption is.
Unionizing your workplace is clapback culture 😉

Happy #lefthandersday to all my fellow southpaws out there 🤚🏽 May your smudges be few and your left seat empty ✏️
Bosses don’t wield all the power. Workers have plenty - yet many don’t know it! Study up &amp;search the history of labor rights in America. School doesn’t teach the history of the US labor mvmt,but we have weekends bc of it. &amp; We risk losing rights if we forget how we earned them.
Lobbyists want you to believe that wages for everyday people rise due to “competition.” History shows that’s false. As long as low wages are profitable, people will be short-changed. Today workers w/@unitehere are leading the charge to change their lives:
For decades, policies have prioritized coal corporations over coal workers. No more. The best way to uplift coal communities is to center them in a #GreenNewDeal - by fully funding their pensions &amp; investing in a #JustTransition.
If you’re a boss tweeting firing threats to employees trying to unionize, you are likely breaking the law &amp;can be sued,in your words, “on the spot.” ALL workers in the US have the protected freedom to organize for better conditions. See @NLRB &amp;union orgs like @AFLCIO for tips.
“If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” - Desmond Tutu
We need answers. Lots of them.
White supremacists were responsible for *ALL* race-based domestic terrorism in 2018. 100%. Trump’s DoJ &amp; Barr then worked **to hide that report from Congress**-all while defunding federal programs to combat white supremacist violence. This is a white supremacist administration.

Did you know that in NYC, all children can have free breakfast &amp; lunch at summer meal schools, parks,+libraries? I visited our program in Castle Hill. Kids, families, and camps stop in for community &amp; conversation every day. Break bread with us sometime!
Have you ever called Comcast yourself, or does someone do that for you? Cause for LOTS of communities, we’d take public internet over oligopoly internet any day of the week.
When workers lead, people win.
Good.
But it is incredibly important that we recognize that perfectly normal, good people are capable of aiding racism &amp; white supremacy. Recognizing that is not about pillorying people. It’s about learning to recognize *the virus* &amp; end an oppressive system designed to hurt us *all.*
What this moment is asking of us is to discuss *white supremacy and racism* as much - or possibly more than - *white supremacists and racists.* When we do that, I believe we will start to make progress.
Recognizing white supremacy in ourselves - our institutions, our subconscious, our own past remarks or acts (no matter how consciously unintentional), is what makes the healing work ahead challenging. But it is not impossible,and confronting it is the only way to move forward.
Perhaps more than the obvious last steps of the supremacist,we must examine the nuance of their first steps. That is a painful inquiry, bc for many, we may see familiarity in those first steps. And that familiarity is very difficult to see + admit. We’d rather not talk about it.
Healing ourselves of white supremacy will be hard. It will be hard because it requires us to confront *ourselves.* We wish it was as simple as denouncing a white hood, a burnt cross, vile language. But we need to address where supremacy *begins,* not just where it ends.
White supremacy is often subconscious. &amp; Clearly, our nation has not been inoculated. WS is our nation’s original sin;the driving logic of slavery, of Native genocide, of Jim Crow, of segregation, of mass incarceration,of “Send Her Back.” It never went away. It was just dormant.
There is a difference between white supremacists &amp; white supremacy. White supremacy is like a virus. Supremacists are those who have been completely overcome by the disease, but supremacy - the virus - exists on a larger scale beyond just the infected. It also lays dormant.

Here’s what we have to say to all of America’s men and women falling in the grips of hatred and white supremacy: Come back. It’s not too late. You have neighbors and loved ones waiting, holding space for you. And we will love you back. ⬇️
#WheresMitch on HR8 #WheresMitch on the Charleston Loophole #WheresMitch on the Violence Against Women Act Boys will be held accountable for their actions, starting with Mitch McConnell.
“Boys will be boys.” Is that also the reason why you’ve chosen to block the Violence Against Women act too, @senatemajldr? It prevents dating partners w/ records of abuse + stalking women (also an early warning sign from many mass shooters) from obtaining a gun.
Toni Morrison will be remembered as one of the greatest thinkers and storytellers in our history. She gave us all so much, and her work continues to give throughout time. Thank you, Toni Morrison.
Incredibly powerful, must-watch moment. Thank you, @esglaude.
Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by - and often relies upon - the cowardice of mainstream institutions.
Hey @senatemajldr - these young men look like they work for you. Just wanted to clarify: are you paying for young men to practice groping &amp; choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch? Thanks.
What Congress can do about exploding white supremacist terrorism: pass gun safety laws, name WS as terrorism in statute, &amp;more. The House passed gun safety bills mos ago. McConnell refuses to hold a VOTE, let alone pass them. He needs to call the Senate back now &amp; do so.
4. Also, have editors of color! Diversity not only in lowest ranks, but highest. News is behind on huge stories &amp; coverage is suffering bc of lack of diversity. I’ve been invited to editor roundtables just utterly shocked that no poc were present. In 2019. That’s a big problem.
3. Don’t let Neo-Nazis on TV,to buff their image or couch racism in “reasonable”-seeming terms/appearance!Sounds obvious but it just happened a few wks ago. Supremacists are experts at manipulation,incl manipulating smart people. You will open a box you don’t know how to contain.
The reason there’s a tendency to “both sides” every issue on TV is bc the medium is incentivized for conflict, so ppl will put the least qualified people on TV to create it (see: climate deniers). Don’t ask “is [blank] racist?” Have experts explain what to do about racism. /2
If I were a journalist/worked in news, this is what I’d do rn: 1. Interview actual experts on white supremacy &amp; give them space (more than 2mins or lines) to educate the public on WS, what to look for. Often. 2. Not frame white supremacy&amp;racism as a “conflict” or “debate”... /1
Using the words “invasion,” “infestation,”w respect to a specific, targeted group of people, implying they are vermin: this is the language of white supremacy &amp;it goes all the way to the top. It’s not a matter of political stances. This is stoking hatred+endangering the country.
Video games aren’t causing mass shootings, white supremacy is. Sadly the GOP refuse to acknowledge that, bc their strategy relies on rallying a white supremacist base. That‘s why the President hosts stadiums of people chanting “send her back”&amp; targets Congress-members of color.
The House passed HR8, a Bipartisan Background Checks Act, *5 months ago* and the Senate has yet to vote on it. It was one of our 1st major priorities after ending the gov shutdown. You’ve been sitting on it since February giving bogus excuses. Care to explain the people why?
Focusing on flipping the Senate should be our #1 electoral priority right now. Presidential candidates have all of media focused on them - they’re good rn. We need to boost Senate candidates &amp; get organizing. What Senate races + candidates are you looking at? Comment below ⬇️
&amp; again, this time asking the FBI. It seems easier to label domestic, self-radicalized shooters who are Muslim as terrorists. Yet white supremacists, who are responsible for far more violence in the US,often escape these charges. Now they’re the #1 source of domestic terror ⬇️
For months, we have been raising questions around how white supremacists have been able to escape terrorist labeling. Here’s one example ⬇️
Many assume Neo-Nazis mainly lurk in the dark, gross, v racist &amp; misogynistic corners of 4chan. But that’s not where young people get radicalized. That’s where they end up AFTER getting radicalized on social. There is a trail of breadcrumbs that leads there from FB,YouTube,etc.
White supremacy has quickly turned into a domestic terror crisis in the US. They rely on you thinking “it’s not a big deal.” It is a big deal. White supremacy now makes up the majority of domestic terrorism in the United States. They radicalize online.
If you’re just as sick of gun violence as an American reality, it’s time to get organizing. Join a local group &amp; attend a mtg: @MomsDemand @AMarch4OurLives @Everytown Or shout out any one of your favorite orgs below ⬇️ (The House has passed HR8, but McConnell‘s blocked it.)
We can no longer bear to see gun violence &amp; mass shootings continue as a norm in America. How many deaths to gun violence could have been preventable with responsible gun safety laws? How many children would still have their mothers? Enough. It’s way past time we act.
Common ground I find with (some) GOP: - Ending needless war &amp; curbing exploding military spending - Protecting civil liberties &amp; privacy rights (I believe people shouldn’t be spied on by gov or corporations, incl your phone &amp; habits) - Holding bad contractors accountable
Thanks to everyone who joined in tonight!

Investigative journalism matters.
If we refuse to see and acknowledge all of our history, including the dark periods, we will repeat it. We already are ⬇️
Predatory lending for taxi medallions have decimated the lives of NYC drivers &amp; their families. 🚕 I’m tired of a vicious cycle where predatory lenders get bailouts, but the people whose lives they ruin are left behind. It’s time to do something about it. ⬇️
To the folks outraged at the academics + experts naming our concentration camp system what it is, what else do you call camps where parents die as their children watch? Discomfort at the truth should spur us to change it. Denial prioritizes our comfort over people’s lives ⬇️

This is what sea level rise looks like. Those who argue that a #GreenNewDeal is too ambitious don’t see that glacial melt isn’t waiting - in fact, it’s happening at a much faster rate than predicted. We don’t have time to argue. We need to act - on a massive scale. 🌎
Thank you! The community is truly coming together around the garden. One mother told me that gardening there as a family has single-handedly made her young son excited to eat vegetables 😊
He showed me some! I’m holding them in these photos. The finished paintings he showed were of beaches in Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 In the 2nd photo, I’m holding one of his current projects. It’s a landscape based on a photo he took, which you can see on his screen in the foreground. 🎨
This morning I visited the garden &amp; art center at @AHRCNYC. I was blown away by how advanced this space is: from gardening to virtual reality, the doors to self-expression are opening in new ways for our neighbors with disabilities. Luis told me about why that’s important. ⬇️
Organizing isn’t just for elections, it’s part of community life. That’s why I strapped on my chanclas &amp; hit the subways this week for Census 2020 - to educate early &amp; push locally. The Census is hiring now. Bronx &amp; Queens residents should apply!
These past few months I’ve discovered the joy of gardening. It’s therapeutic way to connect to the Earth &amp; our food 🌎 I wanted to learn about community garden opportunities in the Bronx - so we joined @NYRP &amp; some little ones to plant some corn in our Castle Hill garden! 🌽
Fossil fuel companies also ship coal ash built up in PR to often poor communities in the continental US. In PR, renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels. There is no reason we shouldn’t be pursuing a just transition there outside of corrupt lobbying. ⬇️⬇️
This is huge problem for many communities, from PR to WV. “Coal waste” is a nice word for ash. It piles up in mountainlike heaps + poisons water. Some candidates last night said addressing climate injustice is a “distraction.” But why should clean water be only for the rich?💧
Remember when GOP got all outraged &amp; fanned controversy when I pointed out how Reagan used racism as a political tool to keep white people poor &amp; people of color poor too? Well, here we have it. Like many racists, Reagan spoke it behind closed doors. @TheAtlantic has the story.
Anytime, @JulianCastro. Good luck to you &amp; our whole Dem field tonight!
“True peace is not the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.” Thankful for the wide, intergenerational coalition of communities coming together - Israeli &amp; Palestinian, Jewish &amp; Muslim, American &amp; around the world - seeking to advance that peace and justice.
The Dem House is a different approach. I’d say the House is arguably &amp; currently structured to be the most conservative of the 3 due to GOP gerrymandering. Being inspirational &amp; ambitious is good strategy! Being visionary is a strength, not a liability, for statewide turnout.
They literally are, &amp;this comment is what erasure looks like. HIGH TURNOUT from DEEP BLUE SEATS &amp;being competitive everywhere is the core of a winning strategy. It’s disturbing to see this Trump talking pt that dense, diverse communities “aren’t the REAL [America/Midwest/etc].”
The point is to stem runaway income inequality, where wealth begins to automatically compound at obscene rates for the extremely rich w/o lifting a finger - often at the cost of low wages. This is a huge driving factor in income &amp; wealth inequality &amp; few want to talk about it.
Wealth tax vs Cap gains tax vs 70% marginal tax over 10 million/year... ¿Por que no los tres?
If you haven’t yet dove into the discussion on reparations, this is a great place to start. #HR40 ⬇️
The Green New Deal decarbonizes our economy while ensuring we leave no community behind, incl job transitions for miners, labor rights, healthcare &amp; wages. Calling the consideration of working people in climate policy a “distraction” is what is truly unsustainable + unrealistic.
Debating healthcare proposals is a perfectly good-faith convo to have,&amp; we should define the terms for clear discourse. There’s a lot of folks branding what is essentially a public option or private insurance slushy mix as M4A. They should call a public op a public op &amp;M4A, M4A.
Immigration policy isn’t about “containing a problem.” It’s about realizing the opportunity &amp; value inherent in all people. Also, for the last time: 🗣 people who are undocumented pay taxes! Public goods aren’t “gifts” to immigrants - they pay for your kids’ schooling too.
Medicare for All is single-payer healthcare. That’s it. That’s the policy.
McCarthyism is the practice of baselessly accusing political opponents of being communists as unjust grounds for targeting &amp; harassment. You are blocking action to protect US elections despite official DoJ pleas. That doesn’t make you a communist. It just makes you a bad leader.
What’s strange about Rep Hice lying about this (I offered sworn testimony, incl names to corroborate) is that he + I share a committee! So let’s keep it 💯: we’re going to see each other at work &amp; you’re going to pretend to be nice to me. Passive aggression. It’s a lifestyle 👍🏽
Telling working class people they are “low-skill” is an out of touch, insulting excuse for poor wages &amp; conditions. There is no such thing as inherently “low-skill” work. All labor requires skill to do well! Ppl know competent+reliable servers,landscapers,etc are VERY valuable.
That was one of the most in-depth political interviews I’ve had in a long time, including @EBROINTHEAM asking questions no one else has asked. Shout out to @oldmanebro, @Rosenbergradio &amp; @LAURASTYLEZ for creating that space &amp; coming at these conversations in a totally unique way
Hopping on @HOT97 with @EBROINTHEAM at 8:15am! NYC, Bronx &amp; Queens: Tune in for a Congressional Update on your morning commute 🌇🌞
You may think the #GreenNewDeal is “too much, too soon.” But setting climate goals for 2030 isn’t due to some arbitrary political rationale - it’s there due to scientific consensus. Simply put, we must draw down carbon by 2030 to stave off climate disaster on levels yet unseen.
Climate Equity means: 🚰 When we talk water, we discuss Flint 💨 When we talk air, we discuss BX asthma ⛑ When we talk coal, we fight for miners’ pensions 🤲🏽 When we talk abt just transitions, we honor Native people 👩🏼‍🏭 When we talk economics, we center working people &amp; families
A Green New Deal is more than switching to renewables. It’s about paying attention to frontline communities: everyday people whose water is poisoned, pensions are robbed, &amp; communities still vulnerable. That’s why we’re releasing a Climate Equity Plan:
Organized, civil, &amp; massive nonviolent pro-democracy direct actions have been happening in Hong Kong, too - in this instance, to expand civil liberties &amp; demonstrate against an extradition bill. Pay attention. These are hundreds of thousands of people organizing &amp; showing up ⬇️
By the end of the mtg, I had no idea if I made the cut. If you look at Oversight, it includes many all-stars of Congress. From @RepRaskin to @RoKhanna, Cummings is a legendary coach who brings the best out of everyone. He makes the country better. You want to be on his team.
He looked right at me &amp; said: “I am going to ask you plainly: Are you here to do the work?” People’s lives are at stake in urgent ways on Oversight. He demanded excellence, &amp; was watching my every word. I said “Yes” &amp;made my best case incl why &amp; how I wanted to be on the cmte.
Let me tell you a story about Chairman @RepCummings. Before new members are assigned to Congressional committees, we have to make our case to the chair. Chairman Cummings was TOUGH. I sat down in his office to make my case for Oversight, and I was quite nervous.
Okay everyone UPDATE on Equifax: for most people the better deal is 10 years of free credit monitoring. There’s apparently a run on settlements so there’s anxiety people are going to get 16 cent checks. But if you choose 10 years of credit monitoring, Equifax *must* cover it.

One reason why drugs are so expensive: Pharma CEO pay is often tied to their stock price. That means Big Pharma spends more 💰 buying their own stocks than in research &amp; dev to make prescriptions cheaper. It’s a huge Ponzi scheme. Congress needs to end the stock buyback.

Today I was asked why we should bother paying interns if they’re “getting experience for their résumé.” Here’s what we have say about that:
The notion of dismantling ICE is nowhere near as radical as the destructive 2003 decision to establish ICE - an extrajudicial enforcement agency that controls a black-box network of for-profit detention centers accountable to no one, even when people die - in the first place.

Members of Congress *still* pass down stories about Bella Abzug’s legendary tenure on Capitol Hill. I just heard one last week about someone who once tried to make her take off her hat 👒 needless to say, it stayed on.
The rule of law means *everyone* should be treated the same in the eyes of the law. That means the rich &amp; powerful should be held accountable for crimes as anyone else. That includes the President. He broke the law. And to maintain American rule of law, he must be impeached.
The climate crisis will not wait for the comfort of politicians. The consequences of a burning planet are coming, and the situation we leave our children will be proportionate to the courage (or lack thereof) we show now. Greta‘s right. Unite behind the science - not lobbyists.
CBP is detaining *American citizens.* How would you feel trapped in a border camp, where guards wear face masks because the human odor is so strong? When we allow the rights of some to be violated, the rights of all are not far behind.
“It genuinely shook me to my core”
Notice how whenever we pursue large spending increases + tax cuts for corporations, contractors &amp; the connected, it’s treated as business as usual. But the moment we consider investing similar💰 in working class people (ex tuition-free college) they cry out it’s “unrealistic.”
This is Trump’s goal when he uses targeted language &amp; threatens elected officials who don’t agree w/ his political agenda. It’s authoritarian behavior. The President is sowing violence. He’s creating an environment where people can get hurt &amp; he claims plausible deniability.
The people have spoken.
Once again: Rosselló must resign.
Yesterday we held our immigration town hall, centering advocacy for immigrant communities w/ @adhikaar,@AfricansUS, @DesisRisingUp,&amp; @MaketheRoadNY Thank you @CatalinaCruzNY for sharing your insight &amp; story as the 1st DREAMer elected to NY Assembly. Your story inspires so many💜
We fight to guarantee: - healthcare - public college &amp; student loan forgiveness - enviro protections - living wages - basic human rights We don’t take a dime of corporate money, either. You: - Jack up drug prices - Appoint Betsy DeVos to scam student loans - Hurt immigrant kids
Commissions are usually bipartisan investigatory bodies to deeply dive into specific events or areas of US policy. I could also see proposals for Commissions on the Opioid Crisis, Income Inequality, &amp; Child Trauma, too. What commissions would you want to see Congress establish?
These proposals are waiting in Congress in one form or another: - @SenGillibrand has introduced the María Commission to the Senate - @RepEscobar has a Child Sep Commission provision in her DHS Improvement bill - @JacksonLeeTX18 is carrying the Reparations Commission in the House
We are going to need at least 3 major US commissions to study and propose comprehensive, restorative action: 1. US Commission on Hurricane María 2. US Commission on Child Separation 3. US Commission on Reparations /1
There are some DC ”strategists” that seem quite eager (almost wanting) to believe that Trump is a secret genius playing 3-D racism chess. They’re wrong. He’s simply an impulsive racist, one who leaves his party scrambling to excuse bigotry &amp; scam the country.
A remarkable testament to the creativity, resilience &amp; power of the people of Puerto Rico. Jet skis, horses, pots, pans, &amp; body paint - this isn’t about people making something from nothing. It’s about the people discovering the power they’ve always had 🇵🇷⬇️
This is what the climate crisis is doing, and will do, to American infrastructure. This is why we need a #GreenNewDeal that invests in a solution on the scale of the problem - and can help our nation transition, adjust, and prevent further damage in the climate crisis.
The subway has been in crisis for some time, and it’s clearly reaching a breaking point. People are supposed to be able to rely on public transit - esp during a heat wave. Robust, transparent public infrastructure investment is needed now more than ever. This can’t continue ⬇️
We can no longer tolerate private equity groups taking over chain stores,stripping them for parts to close them. These Wall St firms fire thousands of workers en masse, w/o severance, for a profit. It’s wrong &amp; it undermines basic dignity AND our economy. Time to fight back💪
There is something special and powerful happening in America. From PR🇵🇷 to Hawaii, people are coming together to protect their dignity, rights, + sacred land w massive, peaceful, collective action. It is something to behold. Hawaii Community Bail fund:
The people of Puerto Rico have spoken loudly and clearly for the world to hear. We must stand with la isla. Rosselló must resign.
The GOP wants to send us back: Back towards injustice, Back to the denial of science, Back to the times when women needed permission slips from men, Back to racism - But we won’t go back. We will move forward. Forward to the dignity of all people &amp; protection of our planet.
Due to decades of inaction, insufficient action,&amp; outright denial, we are long overdue to act boldly on the climate crisis. We must pass a #GreenNewDeal: a comprehensive plan to transition out of fossil fuels &amp; create tons of good jobs. We’re the generation to do it. We must.⬇️
.@MikeLevinCA and I have cosponsored HR230, led and championed by @NydiaVelazquez, to ban this pesticide. Let’s work to protect our kids and get this bill a vote on the House floor.

Dow, a chemical company, gave $1 million to Trump‘s inauguration. Now one of their chemicals, which is known to cause brain damage in children, conveniently won’t be banned by Trump’s EPA. @MikeLevinCA has the story linked ⬇️
At its core, abuses at the border are not about whether some CBP officers are good or bad people. It’s about how our border policies are gravely dehumanizing, &amp; strip all involved of human decency. Once you order people to violate others’ rights, a culture can quickly devolve.
Bronx + Queens (&amp; all NYCers!): This serious heat wave is expected to sustain through the weekend, with heat indices getting as high as 110 degrees. Please get rest, hydrate, check in on your neighbors and know where your nearest cooling center is:
Having a seat in Congress is not about individual glory - it never has been, and never will be. It’s about serving the millions of children and people in our communities and across the country. Everyone deserves the dignity of representation. America belongs to us all. 🇺🇸
Back to business. Today I questioned Acting DHS Sec McAleenan on reports that Trump offered him a pardon if he violated US law to block asylum seekers, &amp; whether those in the CBP group who threatened Members of Congress &amp; shared rape images are still in charge of women+children.
Reminder of what people are calling the “radical, extreme-left agenda”: ✅ Medicare for All ✅ A Living Wage &amp; Labor Rights ✅ K-16 schooling, aka Public Colleges ✅ 100% Renewable Energy ✅ Fixing the pipes in Flint ✅ Not Hurting Immigrants ✅ Holding Wall Street Accountable
In all the darkness, find the helpers. This week, *~100,000* Puerto Ricans took to unprecedented demonstrations to hold their gov accountable. They’re doing it in Hawaii, too. And in NYC, for Eric Garner. It’s not about admins - it’s about people rediscovering their power:
To all those scared for our future: we can get through this better than we started. We have the power to triumph over hatred, division, and bigotry. But decency cannot be taken for granted. It is something we must create, advance, and actively work to build each and every day.
America has always embodied the story of those who seek to advance freedoms for all people, and those who try to conserve them as privileges for a select few. Each of us must decide who we will be in America’s story. We’ve chosen the side of the people.

Calling people who believe in democracy, civil + economic rights, and racial justice “communist” has a long + rich history w/ white supremacy in the US. It was one of the preferred smears against integrating schools, &amp; one of the main attacks segregationists used against MLK Jr:
The GOP Senate needs to stop playing games and pass the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund. I spoke with officers, first responders &amp; victims last week - some on oxygen, others brought scans of their tumors - and they told me the GOP gave them their word. We can’t afford to wait.
Scrip was used by Appalachian coal corporations to control workers by controlling their money - it was called “coal cash.” It was used by sugar plantation bosses in PR, too. Facebook establishing its own currency &amp; teaming up with EBay, Uber &amp; co to do so has alarming precedent.
The good news in getting Trump to explicitly vocalize his racism, instead of hiding it behind vague suggestions, is that his words can be used by courts as evidence of his motivation. AKA his tweets may be used to dismantle his own immigration policies 😇
You’re in, @BillPascrell! ☺️💖👯‍♀️👯‍♂️
This major House bill is being led by @RepJayapal. She’s fighting for women like my mom and girls like me. Learn more about it below ⬇️
My mom was a domestic worker - she cleaned houses to support our family. As a little girl, I grew up reading books on other people’s staircases. I did homework on other people’s dinner tables. Today, as a Congresswoman, I’m proud to cosponsor the Domestic Worker Bill of Rights.
This decision is an injustice. It is further proof we have a criminal justice system that grants some families justice, yet denies it to others. My heart breaks for @RealGwenCarr, Eric’s mother. Let us follow her words &amp; example, and work for a system where #BlackLivesMatter.
You’re right, Mr. President - you don’t have a racist bone in your body. You have a racist mind in your head, and a racist heart in your chest. That’s why you violate the rights of children and tell the Congresswoman who represents your home borough, to “go back to my country.”
Authoritarians rely on mass distortion of reality to further concentrate their power, and they will take advantage of anyone and anything to meet that end. ⬇️
GOP often cries that guaranteeing healthcare in the US will force us to “ration” it. Thing is, we’re rationing care NOW. People wait too long to see a doctor, if they go at all, bc they can’t afford paying cash or bc their insurance is too pricey. It’s time for #MedicareForAll.
Donald Trump has decided he does not want to be President of the United States. He does not want to be a President to those who disagree. And he’d rather see most Americans leave than handle our nation’s enshrined tradition of dissent. But we don’t leave the things we love. 🇺🇸
Hey Mr. President, remember when you bragged about sexually assaulting women, talking about feeling their breasts and genitals, because “when you’re a star they let you do it?” And then you imposed DOE policies to make it harder for sexual assault survivors to report assault?

I want to thank every single person who supports our campaign. 84% of our fundraising came from small dollars. I haven’t taken a single meeting with corporate lobbyists in my term. 100% of my time is focused on you and our future. That’s how people power changes our nation.
Thank you for your support, @CoryBooker
I see @LindseyGrahamSC’s biggest issue w/ Trump’s racism is that it doesn’t go far enough - Graham wants to bring back 1950s McCarthyism, too. GOP is doing this because they have no plan for our future. We’re the ones fighting for healthcare, edu, good jobs, &amp; they got nothing.
.@RepPressley is always so on point 🙌🏿🙌🏻🙌🏾🙌🏽🙌🏼
Thanks to so many people showing up to organize this week - joining Know Your Rights canvasses and sharing information on social media - we kept a LOT of families together this weekend in the midst of ICE raids. Proud of everyone who’s been stepping up to protect our neighbors.
Until Republican officials denounce yesterday’s explicitly racist statements (which should be easy!), we sadly have no choice but to assume they condone it. It is extremely disturbing that the *entire* GOP caucus is silent. Is this their agenda?
It’s important to note that the President’s words yday, telling four American Congresswomen of color “go back to your own country,” is hallmark language of white supremacists. Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans.
You know what we’re going to do tomorrow? Same thing we do every week. Fight for: ✅ Living wages &amp; unions ✅ A humane border ✅ Healthcare + edu as rights ✅ Loosening the grip of corp lobbyists on our democracy They can stay busy defending racism. We’ve got things to do.
As the President showed off his white nationalism for the world to see, #TeamOcasio dispatched Know Your Rights teams to show our neighbors how to protect their civil liberties w/ ICE &amp; others. Local businesses asked for stacks of flyers, too. Thank you to all who came out 💜🇺🇸
But you know what’s the rub of it all, Mr. President? On top of not accepting an America that elected us, you cannot accept that we don’t fear you,either. You can’t accept that we will call your bluff &amp; offer a positive vision for this country. And that’s what makes you seethe.
You are angry because you can’t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder. You won’t accept a nation that sees healthcare as a right or education as a #1 priority, especially where we’re the ones fighting for it. Yet here we are.
You are angry because you don’t believe in an America where I represent New York 14, where the good people of Minnesota elected @IlhanMN, where @RashidaTlaib fights for Michigan families, where @AyannaPressley champions little girls in Boston. /2
Mr. President, the country I “come from,” &amp; the country we all swear to, is the United States. But given how you’ve destroyed our border with inhumane camps, all at a benefit to you &amp; the corps who profit off them, you are absolutely right about the corruption laid at your feet.
Kids are taken from their families under an American flag. They are left to cough in cages, spread lice, &amp; smell of mucus w bald eagle emblems emblazoned around them. A few years from now, these 1000s of children will grow to tell their story. We owe it to them to change.
Lights are kept on all night, depriving people of humane sleep conditions. The cruelty is the point. (PS this is @NydiaVelazquez’s voice translating. If we didn’t have fluent Spanish-speaking members, we may not have heard any of these accounts first-hand from people inside.)

One of the big reasons I don’t believe we should make decisions based on “what GOP will say” is bc they are going to say it anyway. This is a perfect example. So let’s get on w an unapologetic agenda that fights as hard for working people as possible. They can catch up later.
(Also, I hope people lay off trolling you - I’m asking honestly. For a diverse community like mine, it’s hard for my constituents to understand why advocating for them &amp; issues that impact their lives is considered “divisive” or “baiting” to some people. Trying to understand.)
Honest question - The expert witness here testified to how facial recognition encodes racial bias, which has real consequences for making many Americans more susceptible to targeting. I think it’s relevant &amp; adds an important layer. Why do you think we shouldn’t discuss that?
Here’s one clip from a recent hearing on how facia recognition can make racial injustices worse (this tech does not work well on people of color, and confuses innocent people with those who have criminal records):
We have started to sound the alarm on the way facial recognition technology is expanding in concerning says. From the FBI to ICE to Amazon, the bar for consent and civil liberties protection is repeatedly violated, and on top of it all has a disproportionate racial impact, too.
You all are the BEST 💜 Our 2 Know Your Rights training canvasses have filled up - so we’re adding a third one in the Bronx! NYC: Come volunteer TOMORROW 3-5:30pm as we help our neighbors keep safe in the threat of the President’s ICE raids:
You can also volunteer for our Know your Rights canvass TOMORROW 4-7pm. Volunteer here - all are welcome, multilingual vols especially helpful. Over 200 languages are spoken in NY14:
We are here for you. NYC, it’s time to come together. We will be holding Know Your Rights canvasses TONIGHT and TOMORROW to help our neighbors. Today’s is from 6:30-8:30pm:
“Local housing and community advocates are already wondering whether state and county officials got enough in return. “I don’t think we as a community and leaders did enough... How are our families who are earning $20,000 to $60,000 a year going to sustain and afford to live?” “
When we opposed using public money &amp; tax giveaways to build Amazon’s HQ2 in Queens, one of the prime concerns was driving up rents on working families. Looks like were right. Sadly, families are already feeling priced out in Arlington:
We are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Hector Figueroa, a powerful and committed labor organizer who dedicated his life to improving the lives of workers in 32BJ and across the world. Hector’s passion was with the people. This is a devastating loss.
The policies grinding three ports of entry practically to a halt are called “metering,” by the way, and it is completely inhumane:
When Homan says “they can come in a port of entry,” what he doesn’t say is that the admin has practically closed ports to asylees. Out of desperation, families do what Óscar &amp; Valeria(the father &amp; daughter who drowned) did: face dangerous terrain. These are policies of cruelty.
Hey Mika - GOP has alleged that I am lying about the accounts of migrant women at the border, particularly about the fact that they were were told to drink out of a toilet bowl. Committee staff conferred with me ahead of time about formally requesting to be sworn in.
GOP has been stating that I am lying about the translated accounts of migrants at the border, particularly about the fact that women were drinking out of a toilet bowl. Committee staff conferred with me ahead of time about requesting to be sworn in.
Well, just as we said, Amazon quietly came to NYC without needing a dime of public money or special tax treatment. The jobs came without the cost. NYC is an attractive place to locate on its own (incl. public infra!), w/o billions of dollars in corporate giveaway “incentives.”

132 members - incl GOP &amp; Independents - voted against creating the Dept of Homeland Security. Don’t let people rewrite history as if DHS/ICE always existed, or is a no-brainer. It’s a young agency, ill-conceived after 9/11 &amp; sacrificed our civil liberties - like the Patriot Act.
It’s really not that radical. When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned - incl GOP - that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion &amp; abuse of power. Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.
“Ocasio-Cortez’s implication is that, by raising interest rates out of a fear of illusory inflation, the Fed may have needlessly hurt American workers. Powell’s concession on that point is significant.”
Thanks - I appreciate that.
The War on Drugs has grown far beyond our criminal justice system - it’s also evolved into a poverty trap for impacted families. Today I’m proud to work w/ @SenKamalaHarris to undo “1-Strike” rules that take housing opportunities away from communities caught in the War on Drugs.
DHS &amp; ICE are flagrantly violating Congressional orders, just as we said they would. Yet it was @IlhanMN, @AyannaPressley, @RashidaTlaib &amp; I that were wrong to oppose throwing more money to abusive agencies, right? ⬇️
.@KellyannePolls curious how you’re going to defend the child sexual assault that seems to be happening on your watch. Remind me again how sexual assault is a “funding” problem? Bc last I checked ending this is about holding abusers to account, something you can’t seem to do.
Trust me when I say you don’t want to get caught in @AyannaPressley’s righteous fire🔥 Kellyanne is way over her head defending caging children &amp; families in conditions that have killed almost 30 people on her admin’s watch. She may play games with people’s lives, but we don’t.
(Being a woman does not mean you’re immune from being bad to women or genderqueer people. Just like being a man doesn’t mean you don’t have a role in the movement for gender equity! We are all in this together.)
Just when you think all hope is lost, we get a Fox News contributor to realize that patriarchy has no gender 😉
“Catfight” is the sexist term Republicans use when two adult women happen to disagree with each other. The reason they find it so novel &amp;exciting is bc the GOP haven’t elected enough women themselves to see that it can, in fact, be a normal occurrence in a functioning democracy.
One of the most devastating aspects of throwing people in jail is that they can lose jobs, miss rent, &amp; lose their home, triggering a cycle of poverty w/ generational consequences. Many don’t even learn about special jail exemptions until they’re given to the rich &amp; connected ⬇️
Growing your own food is very satisfying. We like to pop outside, pluck some greens, &amp;throw them on the pan after a rinse. It’s WAY better for the environment, too. Gardens can sequester more carbon than lawns. Plus: no mowing (&amp;no gasoline)! Let’s bring back victory gardens🌱
Today I am joining @repblumenauer and @SenSanders in pushing Congress to acknowledge the climate emergency. The US isn’t leading on climate, and we must. Let’s join the four leading nations &amp; 740 local governments that have declared a climate emergency.
Frontline communities are already impacted by the climate crisis &amp; environmental injustice. That’s why they’re named in the #GreenNewDeal. Fixing the pipes in Flint, cleaning the air in the Bronx &amp; transitioning away from pipelines on reservations sets an example for our future.
When Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in 2012, FEMA’s flood maps - which impact the National Flood Insurance Program (!!) - hadn’t been updated since *1983,* before the government even acknowledged climate change was real and connected to fossil fuels.
The severity of today’s flash flood “has climatologically &lt;1% chance of occurring in a given year.” Floods that were once rare (“100-year floods”) are now expected to happen more regularly. I learned in FSC hearings that certain key flood maps haven’t updated in *decades.* 🌎
“A glass of water could’ve [beat a 20-yr incumbt]” “The Green Dream or whatever” “Their public whatever” Those aren’t quotes from me; they‘re from the Speaker. Having respect for ourselves doesn’t mean we lack respect for her. It means we won’t let everyday people be dismissed.
Climate change intensifies flooding, wildfires, &amp; extreme weather. It’s more than 1 day or 1 storm; it’s all of them. Places are flooding where they haven’t before; there are 90-degree days in Alaska in June. The GOP will mock &amp; sow confusion until it’s their home swept away.
If the GOP is suddenly so concerned w/ funding “humanitarian crises” they‘ve created, let’s come up w an *actual* funding package that ensures no person in public housing has to drink poisoned water or suffer cold winters again. Simple: GOP needs to pay NYCHA the $34b they owe.
NYCHA is in a crisis bc over YEARS of GOP majorities, they refused to fund basic maintenance of public housing to sabatoge it. NYCHA *alone* is owed ~$34 bn. I have vids of hearings breaking down this horrifying neglect. But if GOP wants to fund public housing $ now, let’s go.
Unprecedented flooding is quickly becoming a new normal. Despite that, Republicans are tripling down on fossil fuels w/no plan to transition off them, or make the critical infra investments we need to prep for the climate crisis. Each day of inaction puts more of us in danger.
Ok everyone, planning to take a few days of rest within the next few months and am sourcing a few ideas. What’s your favorite US National Park to visit? 🏞 (Any tips for visiting said park also welcome!)

“I had watched for many years and seen how a few rich families held much of Argentina's wealth and power in their hands. So the government brought in an eight hour working day, sickness pay and fair wages to give poor workers a fair go.” - Evita Perón
“I know that, like every woman of the people, I have more strength than I appear to have.” - Evita Perón
At this point we shouldn’t even be asking for #EqualPay for the #USWMNT - we should demand they be paid at least twice as much 😉
USA! 🇺🇸 USA! 🇺🇸 Congratulations and thank you @USWNT for your excellence, tenacity, and champion’s spirit. You did it. And we are ALL so proud! ✨
“Some teams visit pressure. We live there.” - @USWNT 🔥🔥🔥
I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake. This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained, &amp; for what?
I find it strange when members act as though social media isn’t important. They set millions of 💵 on 🔥 to run TV ads so people can see their message. I haven’t dialed for dollars *once* this year, &amp; have more time to do my actual job. Yet we’d rather campaign like it’s 2008.
That public “whatever” is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.
Bleeps happen 😂
Thank you, @SenSanders. It’s an honor to work alongside you and the millions of other people fighting for education, healthcare, and a living wage as rights.
I probably spent the first 10 mos after my primary terrified, too. Each day felt like a tightrope, as if one slip would end it all. Fear followed me around&amp;moved into my apt. But courage requires fear. We should teach each other how we handle fear, to help others be courageous.
Ah yes, now Newt &amp; the GOP are resorting to calling me a liar. Who else do they call liars? - 96% of scientists who agree on climate change - Millions of Americans they locked up in the War on Drugs - #MeToo survivors So I’ll take it as a compliment. Thanks.
(Updated the $ since previous one was estimate of his cancelled Veteran’s day military parade)
Trump spent millions on a poorly attended, 1 day parade days after saying he couldn’t afford toothpaste &amp; soap for caged children. Did he ask Congress for military parade💰? No. Trump held these kids hostage to secure billions for their abusers. Congress needs to see that.
The solutions are right in front of us. It’s just about having the political imagination and courage to pursue them. We can rise to meet the global challenge of the climate crisis with a #GreenNewDeal ⬇️
When members of Congress asked CBP if they knew about violently racist &amp; sexually disturbing secret Facebook group w up to 10,000 CBP officers, they told us they just learned about it. Looks like CBP lied. Reporting shows they knew about it for *years.* This is a big deal. ⬇️
CBP is trying to refute the toilet drinking story by saying their toilets have sinks. The sink in the cell we visited wasn’t functional. Guards told these women,Cuban refugees 🇨🇺, they could drink out of the bowl. This account has been corroborated by other members of Congress.
This is pretty wild, and a testament to why everyday people in NYC have begun to vote out those engaged with Tammany Hall-style political machinery in the first place. Elections should not be decided by lawyers who make millions grifting off the “widows &amp; orphans” court. ⬇️
“Just got back from visiting [CBP]. People say that Trump’s policies have failed. I disagree. I think they’re working exactly the way they’re supposed to. This is exactly what they wanted to happen. This is not a logistical problem. It is a moral problem.” - @DiegoBernalTX
Republicans &amp; CBP (as if they would tell on themselves?) are working overtime to discredit my account from the camps. However, you could remove my entire account &amp; the claims still stand. Details are now being corroborated by independent 3rd parties, from courts to inspectors.
is right about this ⬇️
Happy Independence Day! American democracy was once an unspeakable idea. To challenge the divine right of Kings &amp; aristocrats was to challenge the structure of society. The founders’ notion of a government by the people was incredibly radical. And in many ways, it still is. 🇺🇸
4. Econ: We need large-scale public investment to spur job creation for citizens&amp;immigrants alike. Ideally that investment transitions us to a sustainable economy (climate &amp; income-wise). We are overdue to rebuild American infra&amp;it’s going to take ALL of us &amp; immigrants to do it.
3. Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it’s time to repeal Section 1325 &amp; 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code &amp; into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing.
2. Climate change: There is broad consensus from military to activists that resource strains (droughts, famine, etc) &amp; nat disasters are drivers of refugees. People are fleeing places that were once livable &amp;are no longer. It will get worse the longer we do nothing
A thread of some of the policy approaches we should consider wrt immigration: 1. Foreign policy: Reinstate US humanitarian aid in the Northern Triangle, where people are fleeing. US should start acting like a real partner in Latin America,&amp; increase visas where we intervene.
The cruelty is the goal. It’s called “deterrence” - a policy stance that if our country inflicts enough pain on refugees, they will think twice before believing America is worth their dreams &amp; aspirations. Only policy change can end cruelty, not blank checks to the status quo.
The GOP’s grand plan to “Make America Great Again” is to hurt children, immigrants, refugees into thinking America isn’t great - that it’s cruel &amp; inhumane - so people don’t come at all. But America isn’t America at all without immigrants. To turn them away is Un-American.
When you stand up to bullies once, it gets easier to do each following time. I am used to the right’s behavior towards me - but I will never get used to their heartless cruelty towards other human beings escaping violence &amp; despair, nor their indifference to everyday Americans.
Of course. Our prayers are with you - and we will work our hardest to honor his last wish to Congress.
Fmr. Detective Luis Alvarez, 9/11 first responder, &amp; loving father of 3 sons, left us far too soon. He spent his last days fighting for the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund. Some issues should be above partisanship or delay. We must pass the bill as soon as Congress reconvenes.
Also @KellyannePolls, maybe you actually do your job and show up to a Congressional hearing next time you want to talk to me. After all you, you ran away and skipped out on Oversight committee last week, just to call into Fox and Friends instead. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Are CBP officers waking up women in the middle of sleep a “funding” problem? Is calling migrants “filthy” “wh*res” a funding problem? Is threatening violence on members of Congress a “funding” problem? No, it’s not. It’s a far deeper, systemic, more violent problem than that.
The $4.6 billion wasn’t humanitarian at all. It had NO accountability measures for facilities that abuse children and families. It didn’t fix the problem, just funded abuse. I don’t believe in billion dollar blank checks for unethical, abusive administrations. Including yours.
The right is responding to what’s been exposed at the border by denying it &amp; saying I’m lying. Hard to assert when the details I shared are corroborated by other members of Congress, court documents, migrant testimony, and now photos released today by the Inspector General.
These are concentration camps. According to concentration camp experts, people begin to die due to overcrowding, neglect, and shortage of resources. We saw all three of those signs on our trip yesterday. Another person died yesterday. And those are the deaths we know about.
We just experienced *the hottest month ever recorded on Planet Earth.* Unless we act drastically now, it’s only going to get worse. What will that mean for our food, water, shelter, safety? We need a #GreenNewDeal. Now.
How many migrant women has Kellyanne Conway touched? Hugged? Sat on a concrete floor with? Actually listened to? The answer is none. Her actions show she doesn’t believe all human beings are worthy of basic dignity. That‘s why she defends &amp; muddies the clear and indefensible.
It is important to note that many of these children speak indigenous languages. Some I met were budding trilingual (speak K’iche’, Spanish &amp; learning English). We are caging indigenous people. (HHS shelters, if kids can get to them, have translation lines they call to help.)
And now CBP is pushing easily disprovable lies about members of Congress. Truly nuts. And to think this week the GOP &amp; Dem “Problem Solvers Caucus” fought to eliminate ALL accountability amendments from funding. They just wrote a multi-billion dollar blank check for misconduct.
When you pair: - 9,500 current + former CBP officers are part of a violently racist &amp; sexually violent secret Facebook group - Corroborating accounts of abuse - CBP couldn’t control their own officers for a Congressional tour What else do you call that but a rogue agency?
I can’t understate how disturbing it was that CBP officers were openly disrespectful of the Congressional tour. If officers felt comfortable violating agreements in front of their *own* management &amp; superiors, that tells us the agency has lost all control of their own officers.
Hey, @kilmeade: What was the last “party” you went to where you: - Were locked in a cage under armed guard - Drank out of a toilet - &amp; given food of such poor nutritional value, for so long, that it gave you mouth sores?
And to these CBP officers saying they felt “threatened” by me - They were literally discussing making a GoFundMe for an officer who attacked my on my tour. They confiscated my phone, and they were all armed. I’m 5’4”. They’re just upset I exposed their inhumane behavior.
Pro-concentration camp &amp; Pro-Trump protestors tried to drown out our accounts. They yelled at Rashida Tlaib about pork when she talked about facilities. They called Joaquin Castro “traitor” for denouncing family separation. @AyannaPressley was heroic, speaking truth to vitriol.
Here’s another photo from inside taken by @JoaquinCastrotx, where we’re trying to comfort women trapped in cells. This woman was telling me about her daughters who were taken from her - she doesn’t know where they’ve taken them. We held &amp; listened to them. They were distraught.
These officers felt brazen in there. While mgmt was telling us it was a “secure facility” where *members of Congress* had to check their phones, we caught officers trying to sneak photos, laughing. CBP’s “good” behavior was toxic. Imagine how they treat the women trapped inside.
Even if they let you in, these women told us CBP did a lot of “cleaning up” before we arrived. They were moved into that room from outside tents before our arrival. They said they’d gone 15 days w/o a shower, &amp; were allowed to start bathing 4 days ago (when visit was announced).
Members of Congress had to surrender their phones before today’s CBP trip. But @JoaquinCastrotx was able to get a device in. This photo is of the women we spoke to. We asked their permission to photograph - they said yes, please share what’s happening.
Meanwhile, one refrain we‘ve heard is that people are overcrowded in CBP concentration camps because the shelters (which are humane places where families can stay together) are full. So we went to a shelter. They said that wasn’t true at all. Only 150/500 spots were filled.
This was in fact the type of toilet we saw in the cell. Except there was just one, and the sink portion was not functioning - @AyannaPressley smartly tried to open the faucet, and nothing came out. So the women were told they could drink out of the bowl.
CBP made us check our phones. But one woman slipped me this packet to take with me. It says “shampoo,” but she told me that this is all they give women to wash their entire body. Nothing else. Some women’s hair was falling out. Others had gone 15 days without taking a shower.
What’s haunting is that the women I met with today told me in no uncertain terms that they would experience retribution for telling us what they shared. They all began sobbing - out of fear of being punished, out of sickness, out of desperation, lack of sleep, trauma, despair.
Now I’m on my way to Clint, where the Trump admin was denying children toothpaste and soap. This has been horrifying so far. It is hard to understate the enormity of the problem. We’re talking systemic cruelty w/ a dehumanizing culture that treats them like animals.
After I forced myself into a cell w/ women&amp;began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as “psychological warfare” - waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc. Tell me what about that is due to a “lack of funding?”
Now I’ve seen the inside of these facilities. It’s not just the kids. It’s everyone. People drinking out of toilets, officers laughing in front of members Congress. I brought it up to their superiors. They said “officers are under stress &amp; act out sometimes.” No accountability.
Just left the 1st CBP facility. I see why CBP officers were being so physically &amp;sexually threatening towards me. Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water &amp; had told them to drink out of the toilets. This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress.
There are 20,000 TOTAL Customs &amp; Border Patrol agents in the US. 9,500 - almost HALF that number - are in a racist &amp; sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group. They’re threatening violence on members of Congress. How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?
9,500 CBP officers sharing memes about dead migrants and discussing violence and sexual misconduct towards members of Congress. How on earth can CBP’s culture be trusted to care for refugees humanely? PS I have no plans to change my itinerary &amp; will visit the CBP station today.
This just broke: a secret Facebook group of 9,500 CBP officers discussed making a GoFundMe for officers to harm myself &amp; Rep. Escobar during our visit to CBP facilities &amp; mocked migrant deaths. This isn’t about “a few bad eggs.” This is a violent culture.
We just landed in El Paso last night with several other members of Congress to tour migrant camp facilities. Meanwhile in McAllen, this is the scene (via @Reuters) ⬇️
You can chip in to their legal fund here:
Direct actions of profound solidarity, just like these, hold enormous power to change our country. Thank you @NeverAgainActn, for your courage, compassion, and selflessness in pursuit of justice.
Also deserving of our attention and support: 36 young Jewish activists were arrested today for nonviolent direct action against migrant conditions in Elizabeth, NJ. You can learn more about their advocacy and support their bail fund here ⬇️
For our fundraising deadline in an HOUR, I’d like to share some fundraising w/ ⁦@KatieHill4CA⁩, a swing-seater who stood up for immigrant dignity this week. Split 💰here to show that immigrant dignity shouldn’t be a partisan issue,but a human issue:
(And that’s if they even take out their own trash, which I doubt)
In other words, Republicans who criticize my being a waitress as evidence of lacking skill can take their classism to the trash. You are insulting the capacities and potential of virtually every working person in America (&amp;the 🌎) for having experience that’s earned, not bought.
Some of the most nuanced, intelligent, &amp; grounded people I‘ve ever met weren’t at BU, MIT or Harvard events when I was a student. They were the plumbers &amp; waitresses I hung out with at happy hour, who had ferocious intellectual curiosity *and* a lived context of the real world.
Working people that GOP dismiss as “just a waitress/cook/etc” contain multitudes, &amp; are just as capable &amp; intelligent as anyone. Classism - judging someone’s character by their income - is disappointing to see from them. What is so appalling to GOP about having an honest job?
As always, I‘m proud of my work in restaurants. I also worked for Sen. Ted Kennedy, piloted literacy projects in the South Bronx, studied Development Economics in W Africa, served as an Educational Director &amp; won international science competitions before I ran for office, too.
Here’s how:
Actually, that would make government better - not worse. Imagine if more people in power spent years of their lives actually working for a living. We’d probably have healthcare and living wages by now.
Since when are Obama-Trump voters “ordinary voters?” They are a tiny % of the electorate. (In fact, most voters didn’t even vote for Trump.) So on top of your troubling claims abt taxes, it’s justified to see the word “ordinary” here is a euphemism. The question is: for what?
On climate, it’s easy to follow – and there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. But it is enormously easy because you don’t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it’s a decision on whether we’re going to lead or not. /2
Leadership is difficult. Leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is about doing things before anybody else does them. Leadership is about taking risks. Leadership is about taking decisions when you don’t know 100% what the outcome is going to be. (/1)
Where on the 6 was this? Please tell me this was Manhattan, I’m not trying to get phone calls about this 😂
It may be shocking to some, but being someone’s daughter actually isn’t a career qualification. It hurts our diplomatic standing when the President phones it in &amp; the world moves on. The US needs our President working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn’t hurt either.
But of course, just because a statute is abolished doesn’t mean the unfairness is gone. Remaining are life &amp; death implications of other statutes &amp; *how* laws are enforced. That’s a key part of policy in a wide range of issues from schooling to marijuana + yes, immigration too.
Dred Scott was the landmark Supreme Court case that found the US Constitution didn’t give citizenship to black people. The 1st US immigration law was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a race-based policy that was upheld until 1942. The “National Origins Formula” lasted til ‘65.
The history of Citizenship in the US is deeply woven with the history of racism. It has been used as the legal enforcer of racism for most of US history. Citizenship affords power, &amp; that’s why citizenship of African Americans was long denied too - to both slaves &amp; descendants.
The reason your abuela was “legal” was likely bc there was effectively no “illegal” US immigration when she came, except for the Chinese. The US’ first imm law was the Chinese Exclusion Act, &amp; explicit racism was allowed as legal grounds for US immigration laws until *1952.*
“⁦I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, “What should I do?” And I say: “Act.” It was such an honor to share this conversation with you, ⁦@GretaThunberg⁩. Thank you for being one of the leading voices on climate action today.
Reminder that these camps are run **at a profit** and financed by private equity groups, many of whom lobby politicians to imprison more people. Wall Street has made human rights abuse an incentivized, for-profit venture.
Pretty awful that the right would make a joke of visiting a child CBP camp - but fitting, given that they don’t seem to care one shred about other people’s lives. PS That watch belonged to my dad. It was the last &amp; only possession he left me. I wear it to mark important moments.
The party’s on! 🥳
Yes! 🇺🇸⚽️✨
It may not be the White House, but we’d be happy to welcome @mPinoe &amp; the entire #USWMNT for a tour of the House of Representatives anytime they’d like. 🇺🇸
Gotta love the rich irony of people who fondly recount stories of how their family’s last names were changed on Ellis Island after their relatives snuck onto a boat escaping some horror now taking fervent anti-immigrant stances &amp; branding innocent human beings as “illegal.”
One narrative in this country that we need to turn on its head is the lie that immigrants are “takers,” or represent a weight on society. It’s wrong. Immigrants are *makers.* They create+offer opportunity. They aren’t a weight to carry; in fact, they are our nation’s shoulders.
“Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.”
The emperor has no clothes: the GOP truly has no plan, no agenda, &amp; no positive vision for the future of the United States. We will win if we fight unapologetically for the future of ALL people - incl healthcare, education, labor, human rights, &amp; dignity.
It’s worked in recent history, btw - which is why they keep doing it. It got Dems to kill the public option years ago (imagine the last decade w a public option!) I *wish* the party was as bold as GOP accuses. We’d win more, imo.
Yep, amusing how some think GOP calling Dems socialists is a new thing. a) they’ve called us it (at least) since FDR b) GOP has no idea what economic democracy is The whole goal of this attack is to get Dems to back off fighting for the economic rights of working class people.
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (which is ideologically diverse) concurs, and is officially recommending a NO vote. ⬇️
This Senate Bill will have us write a $4.6 Billion blank check (incl military $) for the border w NO accountability - just a verbal pinky promise. Trump is not to be trusted with protecting our immigrants. Why must that even be stated? We need hard lines of protection, in ink.
We have time. We can stay in town. We can at LEAST add some amendments to this Senate bill. But to pass it completely unamended with no House input? That seems a bridge too far.
0 negotiation with the House. We offered crucial amendments to protect children and families - none are even being considered. A minority is different than a majority. And while the Senate has to deal with its lack of power there, a House majority should have a seat @ the table.
0 conferencing with House Dems. 0 amendments accepted - including CRUCIAL amendments that would prevent more suffering. There is enormous frustration here with the capitulation of the Senate minority. But that aside, we have a majority in the House and need to use it.
Under no circumstances should the House vote for a McConnell-only bill w/ no negotiation with Democrats. Hell no. That’s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do.
Congress gets a Gold plan that we pick off the ACA exchange. Spoiler: Insurance is STILL a pain. I had the “consumer choice” of picking btwn 56 diff plans that were all tough to distinguish. There was a comparison web tool &amp; it’s still confusing. Healthcare &gt; insurance any day.
This President will not lift a finger to save these kids. It is well within his power, but he &amp; Mitch McConnell would rather cast blame than do anything. They need to get on board w/ a clean humanitarian bill. We can’t write no-strings blank checks to abusive facilities.
In meeting I asked “Why can the president take money from other agencies to build his little wall, but can’t move money to get kids toothpaste?” It’s bc his “nat’l emergency” is ONLY to build his wall. But he won’t declare an emergency to save these kids &amp; get them help.
His Senate bill is a militarization bill. McConnell killed the House Bill &amp; dropped this one right before recess to force passage. Well, too bad. This is our job. Cancel vacation, fly the Senate in. Pass a clean humanitarian bill &amp; stop trying to squeeze crises for more pain.
Mitch McConnell killed the House border $ over “poison pill riders.” What are the “poison pills” he’s talking about? Protections for kids &amp; punishment for inhumane facility co’s. The GOP is heightening children‘s pain for political gain. It’s horrifying.
Taking notes on the #DemDebate to share tonight on @colbertlateshow! 🇺🇸
Last week, we called the concentration camps at the border for what they are. In the week since: - Acting director of Customs &amp; Border Patrol resigned - Bank of America announced they will stop financing for-profit immigrant detention &amp; private prisons. Words matter.
Today marks one year since I won my primary election. It has been a transformative year for myself, our community, and the overall progressive movement. As I reflect throughout the day, the main sentiment I want to share with you all is: Thank you.
Yet one more reason to abolish the electoral college 😉
We meet a machine with a movement. 💪🏽💜
I am so incredibly proud of @CabanForQueens - and EVERY single person who showed up for this election today. No matter how this ends, you all have stunned NY politics tonight. When people come together, we can beat big money in elections. People power is no fluke.
😎
Wayfair workers couldn’t stomach they were making beds to cage children. They asked the company to stop. CEO said no. Tomorrow, they‘re walking out. This is what solidarity looks like - a reminder that everyday people have real power, as long as we’re brave enough to use it.
It’s wild to think that Third Way has gotten along with its “sensible Dem” charade as long as it has. I’ve met Trump voters, Ind. voters, but I can’t recall a single voter I’ve met in the US that IDs as a “Third Way Voter.” Just admit you’re a Wall St advocacy group &amp; move on.
Queens residents: Today is the day we vote for DA! 🌞🗳 Communities win when we turn out in high numbers. Let’s get @CabanForQueens elected! Have you voted yet? Check in here if you have &amp; tell us how it went! ⬇️
Reminder: Caging kids is a for-profit enterprise, &amp; the people who profit off camps finance the political campaigns of those who legislate more caging. If you want to follow the money: GEO Group &amp; CoreCivic are big ones. Look at the lenders &amp; private equity grps they deal with.
I’ll never forget this, because it was the moment I saw with my own eyes that the America I love was becoming a nation that steals refugee children from their parents,&amp; caged them. More kids died after this. To date, no one has been held accountable. We need to save these kids.
Yes, the treatment is bad - but the one thing I’ve learned about the right is that they’re all bark. They stomp, they whine, they burst w/ hyperbole - all bc they rely on Dems backing down when GOP creates controversy. They don’t know what to do when we stick by our principles.
If you doubt it, here’s the original tweet. This is a deliberate, intentional, wild jump made by Republicans (frankly, often) for the explicit purpose of eliciting + manipulating pain for political purposes. Meanwhile, kids are still dying.
Reminder: the member who directly + explicitly compared concentration camps on our border to the Holocaust was *Liz Cheney.* The horrors of the Holocaust went beyond the use of concentration camps, yet camps were part of the process. They have also been used before and after.
The student loan crisis is keeping people from: 📈 Becoming teachers &amp; other public careers 📈 Buying homes &amp; large purchases 📈 Starting families 📈 Educating themselves further w/ other specialized degrees As a result, it’s impacting the ENTIRE economy
Student loans are a scam. That’s why I join @BernieSanders, @RepJayapal &amp; @IlhanMN to forgive ALL student loans AND make colleges tuition-free. PS: for the cost of the GOP tax scam (~$2 TRILLION), we could’ve already forgiven every student loan in America w/ billions left over.
We’re just a couple of girls, standing in front of a borough, organizing them to dismantle the carceral state. 😉 If you live in Queens and can vote, vote TOMORROW for @CabanForQueens! (Set yourself a reminder🤳🏼) If you can’t vote, find a voter and send them to the polls.
Remember when the Bush administration bullied media into using their devised term “enhanced interrogation” instead of the accurate term “torture?” Well, waterboarding was torture. And these are concentration camps. Journalism should be about the truth. And this is the truth. ⬇️
I have absolutely zero patience for completely certified, card-carrying and flag-waving racists. None. 🚫 They can take their little tiki torches somewhere else. We don’t give them an inch, a second, a sliver of sunlight nor the time of day. And neither should you.
The last time you went on this trip it was reported that you also met w/ fringe Austrian neo-Nazi groups to talk shop. So I’m going to have to decline your invite. But thank you for revealing to all how transparently the far-right manipulates these moments for political gain.
Hey @Liz_Cheney, you’re the GOP Conference Chair - perhaps you should come collect your colleague before more members of your caucus start saying the quiet parts loud
Mr. King, the Republican Party literally stripped you of your Congressional committee assignments because you were too racist even for them. My Jewish constituents have made clear to me that they proudly stand w/ caged children who are starved, denied sleep &amp; sanitation. Bye 👋🏽
#1: These are people protesting peacefully - hence their POSTERS &amp; not FIREARMS #2: Why do you call some who threaten violent attack a “militia” vs others “domestic terrorists?”🤔 #3: This a very dramatic way to deal with your Sunday Scaries. We can help you find a therapist.
The most BX pride speech I ever gave 😂 they really cued up the horns for our policy points 🤣🏳️‍🌈 There’s no place like home!
When a powerful entity is trying to grow a system of human rights abuse (which is what this is) it’s on ALL of us, from smallest to biggest, to throw sand in the gears and stop it. We cannot be compliant with child abuse. These judges are astounded at the argument for it ⬇️
Reminder this admin is CHOOSING to round up refugees seeking asylum, fighting to not give children toothpaste or soap &amp; making people sleep on dirt floors. They say it’s bc of a lack of 💰. You know what saves money? Not putting masses of people in internment in the first place.
The GOP has supported building mass concentration camps on the southern border. Kids &amp; families are dying. Now they want money for more - w/ ZERO negotiation on how $ is spent. We can’t do that. They‘ve shown that when they get more money, they build more camps.
Please share this info widely &amp; make sure your neighbors have it. If your home can be a safe space or haven for others, let your neighbors and community know - even if it’s just to relax in the stress of this time. Plan, prepare, + protect our neighbors.
Warning: The Trump admin is expected to begin ICE raids across the country TOMORROW, targeting people for round up. NOW is the time for us to come together: - Check in w/ your neighbors - Share “Know Your Rights” info - If you see ICE, report to @UNITEDWEDREAM 1-844-363-1423
This was Philadelphia after an oil refinery exploded this morning. So... what’s that about how climate change isn’t an existential crisis that will disproportionately impact working class people &amp; burn its way up? We need a solution on the scale of the crisis: #GreenNewDeal 🌎
This President needs to be impeached.
As long as the @GOPLeader supports jailing children and families on the border, I will continue to hold him to account for it. That’s why I’m calling on Rep. McCarthy to apologize for aiding and supporting the separation of children from their parents.
This is what the United States is doing in the name of the American people. It’s child abuse, it’s indefensible, and we cannot wring our hands out of discomfort with the reality of the situation. We must have the courage to see this for what it is.
Thank you, @johnlegend. Queens residents: VOTE @CabanForQueens next Tuesday to bring the revolution to criminal justice! 🗳🌹
This administration needs to put down its saber and pick up a phone. Diplomacy is what grants us peace and stability - not war.
Yesterday I listened to the powerful testimony of Ms. Gray, a West Virginia nurse on the front lines of the opioid crisis. She said, “We can’t arrest our way out of this crisis.” Proud to pass this amendment w/ bipartisan support to move away from imprisonment &amp;towards healing.
For folks saying we should gloss over this, I think it’s important to realize that we can’t risk depressed turnout in 2020. The original remark is valid to ask about &amp; have a discussion on or clarify - not dismiss. We should be compassionate toward each other, but not silent.
For the record, Cory Booker does *not* owe Joe Biden an apology for pointing out that waxing nostalgic about working with segregationists is insensitive. “He knows better?” Really? What is “better?” To stay quiet about it?
I’m curious, @HouseGOP: what would you like people to call these Trump-run human cages? According to you, concentration camp experts + historians are wrong. So what do you call it? What term makes you feel better about brutality? “Internment?” “Detention?” “Freedom Center?”
We are calling these camps what they are because they fit squarely in an academic consensus and definition. History will be kind to those who stood up to this injustice. So say what you will. Kids are dying and I’m not here to make people feel comfortable about that.
My heroes are the ones who stood up when it wasn’t easy. Kids are dying in cages on our border. Families are being put in “freezers” &amp; “dog pounds.” Years from now, people will look for the journalists, officials, &amp; everyday people who stood up for what was right in real-time.
Well, @chucktodd - the fact that you slipped in “Nazi” when I never said that is pretty unfortunate. Almost as unfortunate as the fact that you spent this whole time w/o discussing DHS freezers, “dog pounds,” missing children, &amp; human rights abuses that uphold use of this term.
‘@tedlieu repeatedly asked [Sec. Pompeo’s advisor] if the Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war. He would not say "yes." Lieu submitted the Constitution for the record.’ 😂
Today we celebrate #Juneteenth, the day we celebrate the emancipation from slavery in the United States. And on this day, Congress held a hearing on reparations. A massive crowd showed up for it. Ta-Nehisi Coates’ opening statement is a stirring must-watch. ⬇️
What’s worse, Congress has asked DHS for documents on the whereabouts of children taken from their parents. We‘ve asked for details &amp; records on camp conditions. DHS has refused to cooperate or provide Congress w/ the requested information. Why doesn’t that concern @HouseGOP?
DHS ripped 1000s of children from their parents &amp; put them in cages w inhumane conditions. They call their cells “dog pounds” &amp; “freezers.” I will never apologize for calling these camps what they are. If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps - not the nomenclature.
Thank you, @RepJerryNadler.
Someone didn’t go to my Twitter class
Not one dime should go to DHS for building these camps as they detain children &amp; families. Congressional appropriations season is now. That means it’s 💰 time - we‘re voting to fund federal government programs. We should not fund the caging of kids &amp; families. Pretty simple.
The US ran concentration camps before, when we rounded up Japanese people during WWII. It is such a shameful history that we largely ignore it. These camps occur throughout history. Many refuse to learn from that shame, but here we are today. We have an obligation to end them.
Ah yes, because history knows that people who run concentration camp systems almost always acknowledge to the public what they’re doing.
Also @Liz_Cheney, the fact that you employed the horrifying word “exterminated” here (co-opting the language of the oppressor) tells us that it’s *you* that needs to brush up on your reading. Hope you enjoy defending concentration camps. I won’t back down fighting against them.
This video was from 1 year ago this week - before my primary &amp; the Fox News cycle. I flew to the concentration camp where the Trump admin was keeping children they stole from their parents. Back then, I was voicing my conscience. I still am.
Hey Rep. Cheney, since you’re so eager to “educate me,” I’m curious: What do YOU call building mass camps of people being detained without a trial? How would you dress up DHS’s mass separation of thousands children at the border from their parents?
And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps. Concentration camps are considered by experts as “the mass detention of civilians without trial.” And that’s exactly what this administration is doing.
Concentration camps are not the same as death camps. This is an important distinction. One of the biggest lessons from that dark history is that it didn’t happen overnight. It emerged out of slow, increasingly concerning steps that acclimated the public to inhumane treatment.
This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying. This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis ⬇️
🤯
Thank you &amp; likewise! 👑💜✨
Thanks! ✨
If a Schedule I drug shows promise in treating [PTSD, severe depression, opioid addiction], then perhaps it is not the drug that is “morally wrong,” but the law, the schedule - the statute. It’s time to end the War on Drugs.
Right, bc sucking Puerto Ricans - full US citizens - dry while closing public schools, building fossil fuel pipelines against their will, &amp; not allowing them to vote so Vulture Funds can levg the island’s illegal debt for Wall St profit is... old fashioned American capitalism? 🤔
If a person is working 40h/week &amp; is paid so little that they need gov help to make ends meet, it’s not the person that’s a weight on our system - it’s the company. People need to be paid a living wage. We stand up to co’s that rely on food stamps to make up for their low wages.
From “day one?” Really? 1 in 10 of Amazon’s Ohio employees were on food stamps after the company opened fulfillment centers in the state. Paying full-time employees so little that they require gov food assistance is what paying starvation wages means.
Mr. President, you’re from Queens. You may fool the rest of the country, but I’ll call your bluff any day of the week. Opening an impeachment inquiry is exactly what we must do when the President obstructs justice, advises witnesses to ignore legal subpoenas, &amp; more. Bye 👋🏽
Errol SNAPPED 😉
We need to talk about healthcare of incarcerated women + people. Federal statutes prevent funding reproductive healthcare in prisons. That’s wrong. The moment we exempt some, we threaten healthcare for us all. Let’s repeal Hyde &amp; end our inhumane system of mass incarceration.
- MangiPasta on Arthur Ave! SUPER fresh, handmade Italian, family owned. 🍝 - Taqueria Tlaxcalli🌯 &amp; Neerob🍛on Bangla Bazaar/McGraw Ave are both incredible. - Louie &amp; Ernie’s 🍕: top NYC pizza spot (&amp; in my district!)
Looking forward to it!
🎶 Can you pass these bills / For affordable birth control pills / If they don’t want to- / Then the GOP is through 🎶 - Bills by Congressional Destiny’s Child 👸🏾👸🏽👸🏻 cc @AyannaPressley
I’ve spoken previously about our office’s parental leave policy (12 weeks paid leave to ALL new parents - dads included). In the first 6 months of my term, two of my staff had babies and one more is expecting. Here’s how we’ve worked things out so far:
The good news: one of my amendments DID pass w/ bipartisan support: funding treatment for opioid-related infectious diseases. Our leg that did pass will help many Americans struck by the opioid crisis, and the one that didn’t lays the groundwork for future breakthroughs. 💪🏽
Sadly our drug research amendment failed today, but I’m undeterred. I’m proud we were even able to bring a vote on psychedelic research to the House floor. 30% of veterans have considered suicide. These drugs show extreme promise in treating PTSD + more. Let’s keep at it.
This bill has bipartisan support, but it also has bipartisan opposition. Many Dem &amp; GOP alike, are uncomfortable w/ letting federal researchers merely *study* the clinical promise of certain drugs - even in veteran PTSD. Your call can help them see a shift in public sentiment.
During debate, the arguments against it didn’t make much sense. Some were outright false: - legal argument (to take it off Schedule I to study it) doesn’t make sense - we scientific evidence to help do that! - bunch of claims about marijuana - w/o study, claims are unsupported!
Yesterday I offered an amendment to allow Fed researchers to study Schedule I Drugs, incl: - MDMA &amp; PTSD - Psilocybin &amp; severe depression - Ibogaine &amp; opioid withdrawal 🚨 House votes TODAY. If you’re supportive, CALL YOUR REP. Don’t assume they’ll vote for it - let them know.
I’m about to preside over votes again! Fire up your @cspan feeds and check out what amendments we’re passing to fund your favorite federal programs 👩🏽‍⚖️☺️
Dred Scott. Korematsu vs. United States. Citizens United. Party aside, the Supreme Court has gotten things horrifyingly wrong in the past. That’s why Congress must preserve our power and independence: we are part of the check + balance.
Yep! Excited to sign on ✨
What a damn shame. We must pass the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund. It’s not just about procedure. It’s about showing up for the heroes who were there for us. I don’t sit on this committee, but if any of the first responders there today would like to meet with me, let me know.
One way everyday people can help: check to see if your Rep is cosponsored on the bill. Many are not. You can check who’s on it here. If your member isn’t on the bill, call them and ask why not:
Hey there - thanks for asking about the VCF! We just held a bipartisan press conference about it last weekend. Cosponsors are up + the bill is now getting a hearing in the Judiciary committee. That’s the key step we need to getting a vote on the floor &amp; passing the House.
Wouldn’t it be great if these kinds of educational opportunities were available to ALL seniors, single parents, career-switchers, etc at, say, community colleges across the country? Such a thing could be possible with tuition-free public colleges and universities.
Yep, it’s not just about cost of living adjustments, we’re also fighting for a living wage for interns + for strong staffer salaries, too. DC is teeming w staffers whose parents subsidized their low-wage (or no wage) jobs. That’s partly why many policies are out of touch.
In democratically socialist businesses (like worker co-ops) or methods (like collective bargaining) you actually CAN vote for a worker pay increase. Many do! We can’t pass these laws bc of big money. This is how you chip at it. Like I said, it’s not popular but I’m being 💯
It’s not a fun or politically popular position to take. But consistency is important. ALL workers should get cost of living increases. That’s why minimum wage should be pegged to inflation, too. Voting against cost of living increases is 1 reason why dark $ loopholes stay open.
What this does is punish members who rely on a straight salary, and reward those who rely on money loopholes and other forms of self-dealing. For example, it incentivizes the horrible kinds of legislative looting we saw in the GOP tax scam bill.
Yep. Voting against cost of living increases for members of Congress may sound nice, but doing so only increases pressure on them to keep dark money loopholes open. This makes campaign finance reform *harder.* ALL workers deserve cost of living increases, incl min wage workers.
No human being should be tortured by or in the United States. That means NO ONE should be kept in solitary confinement. Layleen Polanco was, and now she’s gone - all for $500 bail + low lvl offense.
Yikes. The CEO of a news media company is almost a *full year late* to one of the laziest takes of 2018. Begs the question: what else is he behind on and wrong about?
We now have *bipartisan support* for our amendment allowing expanded research into psychedelics. This is important, as several studies have shown promise in treatment-resistant PTSD, severe depression, &amp; more. The War on Drugs has caused so much harm. It’s time to reverse it.
Imagine having your home destroyed, or losing your child to a devastating flood, or having a whole crop wiped out &amp;crippling your community’s future. Then someone comes up to you and says, “Well, it’s not the end of the world.” That’s what the GOP’s stance is on climate change.
When the crowd that uses “free speech” arguments to defend bigotry anywhere + everywhere starts to demand censorship of key terms in Congressional hearings, you know something’s up.🕵🏼‍♀️⬇️
I think a lot about the policies I support through the lens of family: - Ending the war on drugs helps keep families together - A living wage + strong worker protections frees parents to invest more time w/ their kids - Healthcare for all ensures parents + babies are healthier
I’ve worked w a LOT of kids in my past educational work. The ones who “act up” almost always have issues at home or otherwise. Esp when it comes to elementary students, suspension + detention can make things worse. What kids need is healing tools+policy that helps families ⬇️
I have met w/ trans constituents who were put in Rikers. These women told me about being misgendered upon arrest (even post-surgery), &amp;forced in cells w/ men, putting them in extreme risk. It’s hard to get treatments, too. Layleen’s family deserves to know what happened to her.
For folks who don’t get it: in NYC, Citibikes charge you per 15 mins undocked. This picture could look like someone undocked the bike + left for the workday. Flex is a term people use for subtly showing off something ($, a connect, etc). Ppl joke that AirPods are a flex 👩🏽‍🏫
By the end of the day, for the cost of this flex you could get close to some AirPods like everyone else
Yes! ⬇️
Is it really that hard to not be creepy?
From the opioid crisis to psilocybin’s potential w/ PTSD, it’s well past time we take drug use out of criminal consideration + into medical consideration. That begins with research. I’m proud to introduce an amendment that helps scientists do their jobs.
Hi!
(It should be free, too - like in the UK!)
Psst! 🗣 Birth control should be over-the-counter, pass it on.
I think the #1 source of misunderstanding in PR conversations is that it seems most people try (consciously or subconsciously) to impose a US “Dem vs. GOP” understanding on Puerto Rican politics. It complicates US coverage &amp; politics as well.
DC statehood &amp; Puerto Rico statehood are NOT the same issue. PR was colonized by the US, &amp; deserves a BINDING process of self-determination. Imposing one’s status opinion on PR, instead of committing to uphold the results of a plebiscite, perpetuates the legacy of colonization.
Sure looks like powerful people are trying to bribe the President into war.
I’m thrilled so many community members came to our #RenewableRikers town hall, but sadly some folks couldn’t make it in. So we held an impromptu session on the street. NY14 is fired up + ready to #CloseRikers, and take it back for the public good ⬇️
The #RenewableRikers town hall tonight was PACKED! Thank you to everyone in the community who came out to listen to one another &amp; envision the just world we want to create together 🌱
5 years after Eric Garner’s death, the disciplinary trial regarding that day is coming to an end. Garner’s death should be treated with the gravity that human life deserves. His life was not disposable.
Thanks for bringing Happy’s situation to my attention! The team and I are looking into what we can do 🐘
Not all Democrats are the same.
Usury laws (aka interest rate caps) used to be quite popular in red states. Did you know Alabama used to have usury laws prohibiting interest higher than 8%? Wonder if there are any Republicans willing to revive that spirit and sign onto our #LoanSharkPreventionAct? 🤔
55 signatories just came out in favor of @BernieSanders’ &amp; my joint call to cap ALL interest at 15%. Supporters include the fmr Chief Economist of the World Bank, private equity CEOs, leading economists, fmr members of Congress, and more.
This hearing was wild. First the FBI witness tried to say I was wrong. I tried to be generous + give benefit of doubt, but then we checked. I wasn’t. Violence by Muslims is routinely treated as “terrorism,” White Supremacist violence isn’t. Neo-Nazis are getting off the hook.
Sorry, but if people aren’t willing to apply principles evenly, no matter the person, then they aren’t fighting for criminal justice reform. People acting as though this is summer camp. It’s Rikers, widely known for abuse. #AbolishSolitary (&amp; no, ofc he shouldn’t be pardoned)
Yes - released from solitary. NYT used the term solitary confinement, &amp; that’s what I am commenting on. “Protective custody” IS a separate practice, but does not necessarily exclude solitary. If he is in fact not being held in solitary, great. Release everyone else from it too.
Paul Manafort is being sent to solitary confinement in my district - Rikers Island. A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That‘s what solitary confinement is. Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.
People are like “HEY there is NOTHING wrong with dad jeans.” 😂 Exactly, Jim. Wear them with pride. I see you and affirm you. Take to the streets on this special day.👖🚩
Will “Straight Pride” be a Freaky Friday type situation where all of our history books, movies, stories, media, news, etc feature mostly LGBTQ+ people &amp; perspectives? Will people have to come out as straight? What would folks march in? Socks w/ sandals on? Dad jeans?
Rep. @JoeNeguse is incredible. If you live in Colorado and have him as your rep, you are in one of the luckiest constituencies in the country! For real. He’s great, daring, smart, and kind. Just watch him here. (Plus he laughs at my bad jokes, which means he is generous too!)
Today, after YEARS of GOP refusal, the House finally voted on the DREAM Act under a Dem majority. The moment when it passed was like a rock concert 🎸 The people’s cheers brought many, many members to tears. What a moment. This is why we fight.
Company money is a tactic powerful corporations use to take over towns &amp; control local workers by paying them in fake “currency.” It’s happened all over, from West Virginia coal mines to Puerto Rican sugar plantations. So what about when people get paid in... Amazon gift cards?
This gymnastics stunt of a take makes sense, considering he doesn’t want to be President - he wants to be King. And our refusal to impeach is making his dream come true.
As a result this hearing (chaired by @RoKhanna!), we were able to secure $16 million in refunds from TransDigm for egregious price gouging in military contracts. For all their talk of “free markets,” CEOs actually work *against* them. They want CAPTIVE markets + monopoly power.
Seems like Trump’s DOT Secretary, Elaine Chao,has been caught trying to use her position to enrich her family’s shipping company. Her husband has lots of sway in US laws, too: Mitch McConnell. At this point it might be easier to ask where in this admin there *isn’t* corruption.
Did you know? The new Queens Planned Parenthood clinic offers healthcare for our trans + gender-expanding friends, including checkups, hormone therapy, PrEP/PEP, &amp; more! Same goes for every @PPact clinic in NYC ✨

Have you seen online platforms make strong, healthy decisions to prevent bigotry and disinformation? Take a minute to celebrate that here w/ a comment or example, or write what steps you wish your favorite platform would do more of below ⬇️
Even from a “market competition” perspective, it’s a bad long-term strategy. The reason young people are leaving Facebook in droves is bc its unchecked toxicity makes it an awful place to be. Think abt this as Big Tech lobbies for monopoly power to prevent mkt competition.
The holy grail of many social platforms is “engagement.” Bigotry + disinformation campaigns are often the most “engaging” (&amp; rewarded) due to their inflammatory nature. Some, like Pinterest+Reddit, at least TRY to address this. Others decide profit is worth the social erosion.
Reminder that @RepJayapal already took everyone to school on #MedicareForAll. Watching how Pres candidates speak about healthcare really tells you who’s studied these proposals + who hasn’t 📝 How much is Medicare for All? LESS than our current system.
✅ Medicare for All IS sound policy - one may disagree w/ it, but plenty of other countries have single payer + better outcomes than the US ✅ M4A IS good politics - it polls VERY well in swing states ✅ “Third-Way” (aka lobbyist-backed Dems) WILL lose the presidency to Trump
Since there’s so many people running for President (&amp; not enough for Senate), instead of obsessing over who‘s a “frontrunner,” maybe we can start w some general eliminations. This awful, untrue line got boo’ed for a full minute. John Delaney, thank you but please sashay away 👋🏽
Queens residents: Set a calendar reminder to vote in the DA primary THIS month, June 25th! 🗳
It was great running into you, @kalpenn!
Couldn’t let this suit go to waste✨ Thanks to some extra rest, medicine + vaporu (😉) we were able to rally + join everyone for a bit at #Pride today. Thanks @CabanForQueens + @JimmyVanBramer for saying hi! ⬇️
The GOP is working overtime to dismantle labor unions, which are exceedingly popular with the American public. Unions secure higher wages and better work conditions. We should support them, even if we’re not in one. (Or look into unionization in your industry!) #Solidarity 💪
Sorry - should clarify! They’re yours to pick up at Queens Pride and our Pride events all month. (Fun fact: we sometimes make limited edition campaign swag solely for in-person events, for people who organize. 🐣 but if there’s interest, we can put these buttons in the shop)
Also, we‘re premiering our new eco-friendly, no-plastic buttons today! (Don’t have to buy ‘em, they’re yours to enjoy for celebrating!) The texture is kind of soft, strangely enough. This is a photo a supporter sent because her cat kept trying to pet herself with it 😂
Let’s celebrate &amp; remember what Pride month is all about - it’s more than buying commercial products w rainbow labels. It’s about acting in celebration, acceptance, &amp; solidarity w of people of ALL gender expressions + sexual orientations. Proud of NYC ⬇️
Hey everyone - I was super excited to march in Queens Pride today, but sadly I came down with a really bad cold this weekend and won’t be able to make it 😭 Our organizers will be marching + tabling at the festival with resources for the community. Celebrate extra for me! 💕🌈
Yep! It means we shouldn’t check our rights at the door whenever we work for an employer. It means workers should have dignity + power - incl. economic rights, like healthcare, a living wage, and a decent education. It doesn’t mean “government owns everything + distributes it.”
Readings from the Misogynist Dictionary 📖: “Nasty” (adj.): 1. A woman who doesn’t bow under your thumb; or 2. A woman who‘s not attracted to you. Ex: When a misogynist encounters a “nasty” woman, he‘ll almost surely try to denigrate her appearance, intelligence, or character.
I’m sure EVERY state passing abortion bans will also be prosecuting ICE officials for the deaths of premature babies that happen in their custody? Right? Since they intend on jailing doctors, surely they’ll jail ICE for the same thing.
I was nervous that I may have lost my touch - still got it! That muscle memory doesn’t quit 😉 Now let’s pass #RaiseTheWage and get $15 an hour minimum for every worker in America.
&amp; I mean improve ALL people’s lives, not only “swing voters’” lives. If all you want to talk about is wages but not the wage gap; marijuana but not criminal justice reform; trade deals but not labor; feminism but not trans rights, it’s YOU diminishing your electorate, not them.
This is why I say that expanding the electorate is a more effective strategy than burning💰to win over a tiny slice of people. It’s entitled to demand “vote blue no matter who” - no matter how “right” that is. You HAVE to deliver a real platform that improves people’s lives.
Yeah I don’t know why people are suddenly trusting alt-right outlets with “scoops” on who I’m endorsing. Let’s use our reading skills. Context clues. If they haven’t ever reported about me honestly &amp; in good faith, why would they start now? I’m not endorsing for some time.

The Housing Town Hall tonight in Allerton was incredible. Housing is a complex issue bc of the links between city, state, &amp; federal law. So what did the community do? Run a town hall with all of us in a room. NY: Want to get runaway rent under control?Check out @Met_Council ⬇️
Okay, with @brianschatz + @tedcruz we’ve got at least one D-R team in the Senate to ban members becoming lobbyists, &amp; myself w/ @chiproytx makes at least one D-R team in the House. And that’s just in a few hours - there will surely be more from both parties to sign on. Nice 👍🏽
.@tedcruz if you’re serious about a clean bill, then I’m down. Let’s make a deal. If we can agree on a bill with no partisan snuck-in clauses, no poison pills, etc - just a straight, clean ban on members of Congress becoming paid lobbyists - then I’ll co-lead the bill with you.
So often, bipartisanship is marketed as: a) something only “centrist moderates” are capable of, or b) giving up your principles to “get things done.” I couldn’t disagree more. You don’t have to abandon your principles to agree.Being curious about other people’s values helps,too.
The Trump administration is trying to rig the 2020 Census to nearly guarantee a gerrymandered Republican majority in the House for the next 10 years. Does that sound like democracy to you?
(I do want to say that while there was some real intense BS at times, the people I worked with there were incredible. I made close, trusted friendships that I still have to this day✨ being in the weeds with people day and day out can create incredible bonds)
Just ahead of coming out of bartending retirement, @ryangrim shares this heartwarming tale 😬 What’s wild is that I’m a member of Congress &amp; I STILL found myself pausing at this, scared of possible repercussions of this story being public. Imagine how everyday waitresses feel.
Some people have brought up Congressional dorms - certainly a possibility. This does happen informally; lots of members live in the same building/apt. Key to any solution (dorm, stipend, w/e) is compatibility w family/spouse- many work overtime, unrecognized, to support members.
There are plenty of examples. Another big one is spousal loopholes. They’re tough discussions &amp; politically unpopular. It’s one under-discussed side to cracking the nut of money in politics. Multi-millionaires can also weaponize these convos to their advantage, for cuts.
For ex, members of Congress have strict restrictions that most of the public don’t have. 1 case: bc of our jobs we *have* to have 2 residences &amp; pay for it out of pocket. BUT we‘re banned from writing it off as a work expense. Boo hoo, right? Well, that incentivizes loopholes.
Keeping it real, the 🐘 in the room w/ passing a lobbying ban on members requires a nearly-impossible discussion about Congressional pay. It is understandably unpopular to discuss giving Congress any raises or perks - &amp; bc of that, there’s incentive to keep $ loopholes open. /2
If you are a member of Congress + leave, you shouldn’t be allowed to turn right around&amp;leverage your service for a lobbyist check. I don’t think it should be legal at ALL to become a corporate lobbyist if you’ve served in Congress. At minimum there should be a long wait period.
Taxes, taxes, taxes! We have sworn Congressional testimony that you artificially deflated your assets to skirt paying the taxes that fund schools &amp; more (a crime), &amp; inflated your assets for insurance (also a crime). Mueller has nothing to do with that. Cough up the receipts 💸
Early coverage from before anyone knew who I was almost always came from outlets or reporters who could understand + identify early dynamics. That means early coverage frequently came from journalists who happened to be women, digitally savvy, immigrants, or people of color.
Also LATINX outlets like @REMEZCLA did digital as well
Other early outlets included: - online progressive outlets (ex. @TYT) - local outlets (ex. @WNYC, @villagevoice) - nonprofit outlets (ex. @theintercept) - WOMEN’S outlets (ex. @Refinery29, &amp; the day or two before, @voguemagazine digital)
.@aidachavez was one of a few journalists that picked up our race before the primary. Establishment power can also include power to silence - we learned afterwards how much active pressure there was (angry calls, etc) to *not* cover my candidacy. She was one of the few who did.
One year ago today, I was a long-shot candidate for Congress that debuted this video. We had no news coverage, virtually no elected officials had endorsed us, and by Election Day we were outspent 10-1. But what we did have was the power of the people ⬇️
What, are you sad I don’t speak as our President does, w top hits like “Just grab ‘em by the p—?” Or going on abt turbines &amp; wind cancer?🙄 I could win a Nobel Prize in Physics &amp; they’d still call me dumb. That’s why I don’t give a damn about misogynist takes on my intelligence.
Your daily reminder✨
Today was a great example of what can be accomplished w/ a #GreenNewDeal! New building w/: ✅ Not-for-profit senior housing ✅ Universal pre-k in building (intergenerational community!) ✅ Built w/ cutting-edge “Passive House” eco methods🌱 ✅ 90% cleaner than standard buildings
That part ⬇️
Mueller is playing a game of Taboo with Congress. His word is “impeach.”
Don’t let them bully you out of liking Voyager!!
A TNG Q episode, perhaps
This guy reminds me of every climate scientist warning people we have 12 years left to cut emissions in half before our future is irreversibly damaged &amp; all the GOP wants to do is yell about communist cow farts “No! We’re not going back to the show!”
Use real citrus juice for your sours, people! You deserve so much better than what you’re settling for 😭
At the event I will also unveil my newest platform policy: Abolish Sour Mix 2020 😉
A Garibaldi/Garibaldi spritz is an underrated brunch cocktail. (For those reading: it’s a Campari&amp;OJ. Pull back on the Campari so it’s not too “woof.” For the spritz, add prosecco or sparkling water, depending on how forward you want it. Mocktail: replace Campari w/ pom juice!)
To the silver spoon classists saying they’re going to “make AOC bartend again”: You’re in luck! I’ll be bartending in NY-14 this week to promote a national living wage. So there you have it, ya bunch of milk drinkers🍼😉 Let’s see if my margarita+mocktail game is still on point
All of this is to say that words matter, and can have consequences for safety. For those who believe in “free speech”: whose free speech do you believe in? Bc some folks using free speech to defend racism are also supporting folks passing laws to allow running over protesters.
I don’t even get to see all of them. Just the ones that have been flagged as particularly troubling. It happens whenever Fox gets particularly aggressive + hateful, too. Young interns have to constantly hear hateful messages (far beyond disagreement) from ppl we don’t even rep.
What people don’t (maybe do) realize is when orgs air these hateful messages, my life changes bc of the flood of death threats they inspire. I‘ve had mornings where I wake up &amp; the 1st thing I do w/ my coffee is review photos of the men (it’s always men) who want to kill me.
Today we held an @OversightDems hearing out of DC and into Queens! It was great to host hearing on the US Census directly in impacted communities w/ leaders at LaGuardia Community College. Thank you @RepRaskin &amp; @RepMaloney for your leadership &amp; @RepGregoryMeeks for joining us!
The reason women are critiqued for being too loud or too meek, too big or too small, too smart to be attractive or too attractive to be smart, is to belittle women out of standing up publicly. The goal is to ‘critique’ into submission. &amp; That applies to anyone challenging power.
5 Principles in the Green New Deal: 1. Go Big 2. Be Specific 3. Set Deadlines 4. Let Them Sue (aka, “Don’t Flinch”) 5. Make Floors, Not Ceilings Awesome breakdown ⬇️
This is not a critique of congestion pricing per se, but it’s to say you can’t just tag any random climate policy + call it GND. Nowhere in the text do we mention congestion pricing. If you’re a journalist that’s going to report on/talk about the GND, READ THE RESOLUTION.
Note to press: It’s sloppy to call any + all climate plans “Green New Deal” policies. Green New Deal policies center jobs + justice in frontline, working communities as we transition our economy+infrastructure. Not all climate policies are the same. Many make inequality worse.
Today, #MemorialDay, we honor the lives of all those who gave their lives, both abroad and at home, in service to our country. It’s a hard day for many. Take time to be there for one another; to check in, share stories, reflect, or mark quietly with a moment of gratitude.
🎶We need a Green New Deal/ To save our planet for sure/ Lots of sun and wind power, Will help us endure! 🎶 Jerry is 97 years old and dedicates his Instagram to spreading joy and acts of kindness. This is his second song of support, and he writes them himself! 😭
Jerry’s back with a new song! 😭
This exchange is a promising peek into what growth looks like in our national discourse on race. Thanks for sharing your experience in this powerful moment, @CodyRhodes.
If they make it, I’ll demand royalties so they can be forwarded to the @NationalBailOut Fund 😉 #GetEquity ⬇️
What gets me is news breaks that this woman is weighing committing a crime before Congress &amp;it’s getting framed by the NYT as some Lifetime drama called “Hope’s Choice.” This is a fmr admin official considering participating in a coverup led by the President. Treat her equally.
If you’re curious about how this behavior (&amp; its defensiveness) should change, check @RachelCargle’s piece: “It is the type of behavior that rests under the guise of feminism, only as long as it is comfortable, only as long it is personally rewarding..."
Yup. Where’s the “no angel” take now? In the immediate aftermath of shootings, media routinely post menacing photos of people-of-color victims + dredge up any questionable thing they’d ever done. But when Hope Hicks considers not complying w a subpoena, it’s glamour shot time.
Take time to learn about it:
Notice the people willing to explain this away, yet when Ilhan’s words are taken out of context, they are the 1st to jump on her. Look at how these accusations are selectively enforced on the left, esp when it’s the *alt-right* actually committing antisemitic violence in the US.
Can ⁦@politico⁩ explain to us how photoshopping money trees next to the only Jewish candidate for president and talking about how “cheap” and rich he is *isn’t* antisemitic? Or are they just letting this happen because he’s a progressive politician they don’t like?
Ever since the Bush Admin, Patriot Act, &amp; creation of Dept. Homeland Security, the dangerous erosion of American civil liberties has worsened. We’re melting away our Constitutional rights - all for the excuse of hating immigrants. We’re shredding what it means to be American.⬇️
Wow! When Trump tweeted that spliced video of Ilhan a few weeks ago to a weak response in the House, I definitely didn’t think he’d try it again + escalate. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Whatever this lawless President does to one of us, he does to all. Until we learn that lesson, he will keep going.
If Fox News said it, it must be true! 🤣
A highlight from last night: @RuPaul reading Betsy DeVos as she opened the library 👓📚
It ALL started with everyday people. You would really be surprised how much work here gets started because a journalist picked up on a story, or advocates organized people to command notice of an issue. It’s inspiring how much power everyday people have. We just need to use it.
We held the hearing. PrEP is going generic a year early. It was thanks to: - Everyday people who advocated &amp; didn’t quit until someone listened - A young staffer who listened &amp; dug in - Committee staff that took her seriously - Generous leadership that cultivates the next gen /5
Chairman/woman leadership varies widely in style. For ex, Seniority matters a LOT in Congress. But Chairman Cummings is generous w/ junior members. He invests a lot of time in training a high standard of excellence on the Committee of ALL members. So he gave us a rare shot. /4
In working with our staffer, Oversight Committee was able to pull in request a great deal of docs and evidence in the case. Bc Dems won the House, Dems control committees + Chairs. It was the leadership of the Chairman @RepCummings that brought the issue to a hearing. /3
After vetting the case these organizers presented, she saw that it seemed they were. She passed it by me and our office engaged the Oversight Committee. Committee staffers are CRITICAL. They have the expertise, tenure, relationships, etc to investigate issues + inquiries. /2
Let’s talk abt how Gov works behind the scenes: Remember that Big Pharma hearing last week? Here’s how it happened. A 23 y/o staffer in my office met w/ local HIV advocates. They argued the CDC held the patent for PrEP &amp; Gilead was price gouging. She picked it up + dug in. /1
We often see when Congress doesn’t work. But a House majority *can* get things done - even in a divided gov. Ex 1:Journalists found that the ONLY hospital in Vieques was in shambles. We took up the case. Now it’s getting rebuilt.S/O to Rep. @NydiaVelazquez for leading on PR.⬇️
Yesterday, GOP moved to silence Lauren Underwood’s words bc she had the audacity to say the obvious: that stealing children away from their parents, trafficking, &amp; caging them w/o end is intended to do harm. They tried to silence her; make her back down. She didn’t. Be proud 👏🏽
That’s twice in two weeks that a *majority of GOP voters* have polled favorably with our policy initiatives. We’re taking their base by fighting for their dignity. That’s why Fox News, corp lobbyists, &amp; conservative trolls (trinity of the right, I guess) are coming hard for us.
Ending the War on Drugs means we must transform DA offices across the country. In Queens, @CabanForQueens wants to set a new model for the country: ✅ End Cash Bail ✅ Stop Prosecuting Drug Use (it’s a HEALTH issue!) ✅ No Corporate $ Donate + help here:
In fact, the same thing that happened with Steve Mnuchin &amp; Sears also happened with Toys R’ Us. Workers have had their promised severance stolen by Wall St - this vid is from Thanksgiving. Here’s how it’s playing out w/ Toys R Us workers in the Bronx ⬇️
When companies like Toys R’ Us &amp; Sears go down &amp; lay off thousands, people think it’s “internet kills brick + mortar.” That’s not the full story. CEOs+boards load these co’s w/ debt to enrich themselves, tank them, &amp; leave workers in the cold w/o promised severance. No more.
With GoT out of the way, let’s talk Sec. Steve Mnuchin’s receipts. 🧾 Mnuchin went on the Sears board as his college roommate served as CEO. Together, they fired a *quarter million people* in a debt scheme that looks awfully self-dealing. We want to get to the bottom of it. ⬇️
BREAKING NEWS: Lady Had A Job, Got Paid More Than Me Nice work. Now do the amount of Wall Street, Big Pharma, &amp; Fossil Fuel 💰 presidential candidates accepted over their careers &amp; how much they’re taking now.
People often ask questions about impeachment (“Are you going to impeach?“), but treat it as though it’s one, singular action. Impeachment is a process. Some people may support pursuing some parts of that process, &amp; not others. Read Rep. @davidcicilline’s thread to learn more ⬇️
This hits too close to home 🙃
Agreed. It’s possible some NYC reporters, like other NYers, are so used to NYC’s political machines that perspectives are shaped by them more than we realize. I’m not here to replace 1 machine w/another,or unilaterally oppose all incumbents.I’m here to support people+principles.
The US imprisons more than any other country in the world. To change that, we must elect District Attorneys that measure success in actual community safety, not # of people locked up. That’s why I endorsed @CabanForQueens for Queens DA. Vote June 25th:
I may work in government, but when it comes to tech, I’m no Stranger in a Strange Land 😉
Check the sky for flying 🐽 bc Rep. Meadows, much of the Freedom Caucus &amp; I are in agreement on preventing total surveillance of Americans without their knowledge. Whether it’s Amazon or Gov, no one should be tracked w/o consent or a warrant.
When tech companies develop algorithms that automate the assumptions of people from one demo, they start to automate subconscious bias. When those flawed algorithms get sold to law enforcement, it can be disastrous for anyone that doesn’t look like most Silicon Valley engineers.
Don’t want Amazon &amp; Gov agencies selling + harvesting your facial recognition data without your knowledge? Welcome to the fight for Roe v Wade! Welcome to the fight for criminal justice reform! Welcome to the fight for privacy! Welcome to the fight for the 4th + 14th amendments!
When I ran last year, everyone and their cousin endorsed my opponent. After he lost,did people imply that the Gov’s endorsement wasn’t powerful anymore? That virtually every single union in NYC no longer had influence? No! It was about the candidates and the race. It always is.
I endorsed @CabanForQueens for DA not out of a “power move,” but because to me it feels like the right thing to do. Electing a public defender to a DA’s position with her platform could be transformative, &amp;the organizers busting their butts on the ground have earned recognition.
Perhaps an unpopular opinion: I don’t believe endorsements are a particular “test of influence.” I think it’s insulting to both the candidate and organizers working tirelessly to imply that. Endorsements don’t determine campaigns - organizers do.
This is a public announcement that we successfully grew, harvested, &amp; ate spinach, collard greens, &amp; swiss chard from the garden plot! As such, I now reserve the right to use this emoji 👩🏾‍🌾
Thank you!
.@AyannaPressley is breathing 🔥 in FSC right now and it is glorious to watch. Good job sis.
Who says progressives can’t get stuff done? Thank you @SecretaryCarson for your testimony in front of the Financial Services Committee today. We have many crises in housing, &amp; I look forward to reversing the unjust legacy laws from the War on Drugs in our public housing system.
Working family-focused policies + Game of Thrones gender convos Elect you an official that can do both 😉 (+ keep an eye out this week for another vid on something we’re working on!)
Remember, Clinton was also impeached - that failed in Sen too. Our institutions didn’t suffer then, but they have been damaged greatly today w unwillingness to impeach. Whether it’s Dem fear or GOP recklessness, doesn’t matter. Failure to impeach now is neglect of due process.
Just as what happens in the House doesn’t control Senate, what happens in the Senate shouldn’t control the House. DoJ outlined ev of 10 criminal instances. Pres is now obstructing legally binding subpoenas. We need to do our job &amp; vote on impeachment. What Sen does is on them.
It is just as politicized a maneuver to not impeach in the face of overwhelming evidence as it is to impeach w/o cause. Congress swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. That includes impeachment. We have a duty to preserve our institutions + uphold the rule of law.
Obrigada por ter vido, Dep, Molon! Brazil’s stewardship of the Amazon places a critical part of the world’s climate security in their hands. It was great to meet w the Congressional leader of Brazil’s progressive coalition to discuss bringing #GreenNewDeal principles abroad 🇧🇷
Shout out to @RepJayapal for leading on Medicare for All. Her leadership on #M4A in the House has made it stronger than ever, and she also secured its first-ever hearing in the bill’s history. 💪🏽💜
DC Consultants: “Hm, Medicare for All is an insanely popular proposal. Maybe we should try policies that guarantee healthcare to all people.” Walmart, Exxon, &amp; Wall St corps who rely on underpaying people, cutting benefits + skirting taxes for excess profit: No DC Consultants:
It’s important to note that people shouldn’t be in a situation where they depend on a stranger’s enormous act of charity for this kind of liberation to begin with (aka college should be affordable), but it is an incredible act of community investment in this system as it is. 🎓
Every Morehouse Class of 2019 student is getting their student debt load paid off by their commencement speaker. This could be the start of what’s known in Econ as a ‘natural experiment.’ Follow these students &amp; compare their life choices w their peers over the next 10-15 years.
On Oversight, Chairman @RepCummings reserves a gratitude for those who testify after experiencing unimaginable loss: “Thank you for turning your pain into power.” Pain like this should never happen. To turn it into power takes a strength that many of us may never understand. ⬇️
.@JayInslee’s climate plan is the most serious + comprehensive one to address our crisis in the 2020 field. It meets key marks: ✅ Big enough ✅ Fast enough ✅ Economically stimulating for working people ✅ Acknowledges injustice + w/ an eye to make communities whole
How to Bail Out Main Street, Not Wall Street: 💳 Cap All Interest Rates at 15% (includes Credit Cards &amp; all lending) 💸 Federal Student Loan Cancellation (for the past) 🎓 Tuition-Free Public Colleges (for the future) 👩🏾‍⚕️Medicare for All (no egregious medical debt w/single payer)
Our radical, totally crazy idea to reduce the demand on our social safety net (food stamps, Medicaid, WIC, etc): Pay people more.
It still blows my mind that the CEOs who crashed our economy + caused millions of people to lose their homes not only escaped handcuffs; but got bonuses, too.💸 Many still have influential roles shaping the economy today. But we’re the crazy ones for wanting to tax ‘em, right?
White Supremacists get charged w hate crimes. Muslims get charged w terrorism. This is a HUGE difference. Hate crimes are underreported, deprioritized, + aren’t treated as seriously as domestic terror charges. Yet in the US, Neo-Nazi violence far outnumbers Islamic extremism.
When a mass shooting is committed by a Muslim, the crime is almost automatically labeled as Domestic Terrorism. But when White Supremacists like Dylann Roof shot up a black church, or attack the Tree of Life Synagogue, the FBI declined to charge them w/ Domestic Terrorism. Why?
Fun fact: #GreenNewDeal is a **resolution** - aka an overarching policy framework - NOT a bill. So if you’re curious about what a world with a #GreenNewDeal might look like, @MikeLevinCA’s Zero-Emission Vehicle Bill is a great example! ⬇️
What angers me about the GOP’s attempts to turn the United States into a far-right Christian theocracy is how dishonest they are about it. At least be forthright about your desire to subvert and dismantle our democracy into a creepy theological order led by a mad king.
The GOP doesn’t care about babies at all - especially brown, black, or poor ones. If they did, they’d: - cosponsor the Green New Deal or at LEAST have a real climate plan - guarantee healthcare so ALL can get prenatal care - not stand for the death+caging of babies on our border
To the GOP extremists trying to invoke “the unborn” to jail people for abortion: Where are you on climate change? OH right, you want to burn fossil fuels til there’s hell on Earth. If they were truthful about their motives, they’d be consistent in their principles. They’re not.
Yep! I’m just carrying it in the House and whipping votes there 😉 but if Mitch McConnell wants to actually use religious principles for good + reinstate usury laws, he’s more than welcome.
Usury - aka high interest - happens to be explicitly denounced in the Bible (&amp; in many other religions). Looking forward to having the religious right uphold their principles + sign onto my bill. 😇 Unless of course they’re only invoking religion to punish women + queer people.
.@KatieHill4CA went IN on Big Pharma payouts + bonuses today 🔥 Usually CSPAN zooms in pretty tight on members - I didn’t realize my reactions cheering her on were on camera until she showed it to me 🤣
If male politicians could get pregnant, there would be as many Planned Parenthood clinics as there are Post Offices. 💌📬
Spoiler: Because Australia has universal healthcare.
We all have our hard days, but turning it around is all about perspective. People often ask me how I deal w/ negativity. In person, the ➕ far outweighs the ➖. These notes sometimes get taken down, only for new ones to pop up the next day. Thank you everyone for the support 💕
Ultimately, this is about women’s power. When women are in control of their sexuality, it threatens a core element underpinning right-wing ideology: patriarchy. It’s a brutal form of oppression to seize control of the 1 essential thing a person should command: their own body.
Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies. They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women. From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, US religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology.
Thank you Rep. Raskin - it’s all because I get to learn from the best! Thanks for your leadership in calling + prioritizing this hearing.
Thanks for your advocacy! It‘s wrong that many children eligible for adoption go without adoptive families due to discrimination against the LGBT+🏳️‍🌈 community. A loving family is a core element of wellbeing + happiness. That chance shouldn’t be taken from any child or parent.
Today’s hearing on White Supremacy was powerful. Heather Heyer’s mother, @SusanBro7, offered testimony on how ‘being non-racist isn’t good enough; we must be anti-racist.’ We also learned how white supremacist mass shootings escape FBI “domestic terror“ classification &amp; more.
Not technically the 1st time, a few weeks ago I briefly covered for @RepRaskin for a few minutes as he quickly ran to a vote in Judiciary. But this is definitely my first time chairing for a significant amount of time!
1st Q today: to military contractor TransDigm, w/ a history of price gouging the public. Their 3in clutch disc costs $32 to make. They charged DoD $1,443 149x. How many kids could we have sent to college tuition-free at the cost of their unfair gouging?
Actually it *would* be a felony for women - if those women are medical providers. See? According to your own semantic standard, you “lied.” We can fact-check obvious semantics all day and make absurd bad faith claims if that’s how you want be. But I have better uses for my time.
It’s a felony punishable by jail, incl cases of women pregnant by rape or incest. Twitter is 280 chars - read the context clues in grammar of the tweet. But good to know you’re here to promote criminalizing medical providers aiding victims of rape and incest! 👍🏽 good job
This law would force children - 12 year olds - to carry a pregnancy by their rapist. This law would force people w/ mental disabilities to carry pregnancy by rape to term. This law forces people to be pregnant against their own consent. It’s horrifying.
Alabama lawmakers are making all abortions a felony punishable w jailtime,incl women victimized by rape+incest. Of course, no added punishments for rapists. It’s going to @GovernorKayIvey‘s desk. She will decide the future of women’s rights in Alabama.
😊 Oh, what’s that? All these spooky “socialist” proposals are winning over vast majorities of GOP voters because they are common-sense, humane policies? Ya don’t say.
Thank you Q.U.E.E.N.! 👑💕
Until very recently, there were few mothers of young children in Congress. Today is quite different. We could still use a lot more, but watching moms like @katieporteroc, @RepGraceMeng, @RashidaTlaib &amp; others navigate motherhood in office is so inspiring to me.
The Senate Intel Committee (which is GOP-controlled!) issued a legally binding subpoena, &amp; Sen. @LindseyGrahamSC advised that individual to ignore it. If Lindsey Graham wants to work for Trump so badly, he can resign his seat and move his office down a few blocks to do so.
.@SenMarkey, longtime climate leader + #GreenNewDeal Senate lead, was on 🔥 at last night’s rally!
So much of our healthcare is needlessly expensive. When people vote for another military budget increase &amp; then ask, “How are you going to pay for Medicare for All?” What they actually mean is, “How are you going to keep Big Pharma profits high if we can’t price gouge anymore?”
We’ve organized 1,500 people on a Monday night for a climate rally at @HowardU demanding a #GreenNewDeal. Watch the stream:
But also if you’re a staffer getting invited to a spa weekend funded by lobbyists, maybe ask yourself why you’re saying yes to that. It’s like those timeshare co’s who offer free vacations to people. You THINK you’re gonna say no, but they do it for a reason.
So sometimes you think you’re getting some straightforward info by some professor here or there, as if it’s a CRS report or something. But instead they just saying “objectively” that social security isn’t worth saving, etc. Without other viewpoints.
It’s not that simple. Oftentimes you have no idea you’re listening to a lobbyist bc they incorporate 3rd party groups with confusing names. I saw this 1st hand at the Harvard “Orientation” hosted by AEI. It was marketed at “objective” (lobbyists always say they’re objective).
It’s that bundle 💰 for elections, so you pick up their call,accept invites, become friends. In practice it’s not transactional, it’s social. So while ppl don’t see how lobbying influences votes, their whole enviro + staff has been exposed to mainly 1 point of view: lobbyists’.
When I was looking at lobbying from the outside, just as a normal voting citizen, it appeared to me as more transactional in nature than it actually is. It’s not necessarily that a lobbyist calls you and says “vote/don’t vote for this bill or we won’t donate to you again...” /2
This is how corporate lobbying works: Lobbyists ID bills they need to kill to keep profits high (no matter the human cost), come up w/ “sensible” talking points to mask intent + say policy is “misguided,” then schmooze policymakers in secret into accepting said talking points.
It’s true. The #GreenNewDeal, as much as GOP hiss, scream, storytell &amp; cry about it, has forced even the most entrenched Tea Partiers into publicly abandoning their climate denial stance. The reason they’re so focused on discrediting the GND is because it’s a winning policy. ⬇️
This is why a “middle ground” approach to our climate crisis is unacceptable. This isn’t like other issues where you can pretend you’re a sober adult by cutting the difference between left and right. You’re either fighting for our future or you’re not.
Happy #MothersDay! Let’s celebrate by making 3 months paid parental leave the minimum standard for all workers in the United States. 🌹
If you think your ‘celibacy’ is due to “female empowerment,” maybe it’s because far too many people relied on the disempowerment + silence of women to not be ‘celibate’ in the first place.
Direct 🍎 action 🥦 gets 🍇 the goods! 🍒🛒 Congratulations to Stop &amp; Shop workers, who along w/ teachers + many other workers over the past year successfully protected their salary &amp; working conditions from cuts through collective action.
A little over 1 year ago today. ⬇️
This is a technique of the GOP, to take dry humor + sarcasm literally and “fact check” it. Like the “world ending in 12 years” thing, you’d have to have the social intelligence of a sea sponge to think it’s literal. But the GOP is basically Dwight from The Office so who knows.
And in the meantime, as we continue fighting for Medicare for All, a living wage, &amp; more: Unionize your workplace. Demand a raise. And don’t stop until you get one. 💪🏽
Ultimately, living in a moral society, a good nation, means establishing some basic standards of dignity: - healthcare as a right - a living wage - public education that prepares for civil society + economy (which now shld incl college) - all people having power in the economy
When we say “tax the rich,” we mean nesting-doll yacht rich. For-profit prison rich. Betsy DeVos, student-loan-shark rich. Trick-the-country-into-war rich. Subsidizing-workforce-w-food-stamps rich. Because THAT kind of rich is simply not good for society, &amp; it’s like 10 people.
US GDP is at an all-time high. As a nation, we are more prosperous than we ever have been. But that’s simply not the lived truth. Even now, I’m paid similar to a doctor or corporate lawyer - many who‘d think they are “rich,” but it’s nowhere near what we actually mean in policy.
It’s a big part of what makes this Chase tweet so bad. It’s the idea that if you choose to have any expense beyond mere animalistic survival - an iced coffee, a cab after a 18hr shift on your feet - you deserve suffering, eviction, or skipped medicine. You don’t. Nobody does.
The myth that bad credit or struggling w bills = irresponsibility is a heinous myth. Paying people less than what’s needed to live is what’s actually irresponsible. GDP + costs are rising, wages are not. That doesn’t mean YOU’RE bad. It means working people are set up to fail.
Now I’m going through a huge income transition compared to living off tips (which diff pay every week, very hard). &amp; I have HEALTH INSURANCE, which now means I have fewer expenses. According to banks, I’d be more “responsible,” but my character hasn’t changed. Just my math. /3
When I was waitressing, I used to jerk awake in the middle of sleep worried that I may have forgotten if a bill cleared, or if I had enough 💰 to pay a Dr in cash. Was that bc I was “irresponsible?” No. It’s bc I wasn’t being paid a living wage as cost of living skyrocketed. /2
Going from waitressing a year ago to now carries a LOT of life-adjustments. But 3 paychecks in has shown me how 1 of the greatest scams in US is the idea that financial struggle is due to “poor character.” It’s a huge myth designed to keep people from empowering themselves. /1
In our house, we name a Queen of Hearts 👑 @NinaWest that is YOU! Thank you for being a relentless example of kindness, consciousness, compassion, and courage. Thank you for using your gifts to focus on voices + issues that deserve all the shine and elevation in the world. 🌎🏳️‍🌈
Hell yeah ✊🏿✊🏻✊🏽
If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment. The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s “electable” in 2020. Don’t buy it. Vote your values.
The forces getting in the way of solving our climate crisis are politicians themselves + lobbyists. It is the willingness to bend to corporate power - the same ones that use coal miners’ plights for a tax break, yet refuse to pay for those same miners’ healthcare for black lung.
All of this is to say don’t let any politician, no matter the party, lecture you about what is “possible” or “electable.” Don’t ever let a politician imply that working people are “less-than” or “uneducated” - aka that they are the ones in the way of solving the climate crisis.
Then he said, “I like you. I can tell that you are genuine and fighting for us. You’re real and you get it.” I thanked him and his family from the bottom of my heart.
I somehow got it out: “With all respect sir, how do you... manage to support both of us at the same time?” This is what he said: “I’ve been saying for years that climate change is our most important crisis. You’re one of the only ones who‘s been willing to be decisive on it.”
I was pretty astonished. We shook hands, he introduced himself, and told me he wanted to show his support. I could barely get my question out - I wanted to honor his positivity, yet respectfully find a way to ask, “How?”
About an hour ago, I was walking out of my office for the day. There was a man what I believe was his teenage son hanging a small sign they made outside my office (we let people leave well wishes on our wall). Astonishingly, his sign read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.”
This is a dealbreaker. There is no “middle ground” w/ climate denial &amp; delay. Blaming “blue collar” Americans as the main opponents to bold climate policy is gas lobbyist 101. We’re not going to solve the climate crisis w/ this lack of leadership. Our kids’ lives are at stake.
Today I presided over the House floor for the first time. Every day here is a sacred privilege + responsibility entrusted to me by my community. I never forget that, and moments like these drive it home. Thank you to the people of NY14 + beyond. This House belongs to all of us.
Lastly, if anyone has recommendations for baby gear that folds up nicely or tips on how to prep a workplace for little ones, please give me your recs! If you’re a new mom/parent + could bring your babies / kids to work, what would help that? What would you want to see? ⬇️
8. This is convo is bigger than parental leave - it’s a larger conversation about how modern work has grown so hostile to family life. It doesn’t have to be that way! Work + family can go together, but we have to break down the barriers that force people to choose between them.
7. Additionally, paying a living min wage to our most junior staffers means they’re talented + capable (no 2nd job) to take over big-time situations, meaning senior staffers are confident enough in them to take parental leave and not feel like everything will fall apart.
6. We make an effort to make our office family-friendly. We talk about what play mats + cribs we need along w/ our legislative agenda. My personal office can be used for pumping/feeding. Staff can bring their babies to work if they like &amp; we are working to prepare to have them.
5. Equal pay at work is about SO much more than the salary you offer. If you give dads less paid parental leave than moms, you’re contributing to the pay gap. If you see pregnancy or family as a workplace obstacle, you’re contributing to the pay gap.
4. I want to reiterate how important it is to give dads full parental leave. I strongly encourage them to take the full time. I’ve heard the “normal” paternity leave is 2 weeks. That is NOT okay! As my partner says: “What do employers expect those new moms to do? Walk it off?”
3. Our 12 weeks parental leave is up to the parent on how they want to use that time. They don’t have to take all 12 weeks at once - for example, they can take 5 weeks off and work 2 days a week to transition in; bank 3 weeks for later in the year, etc. /4
2. Paid parental leave applies to ALL new parents, period. Moms, dads, parents; biological or adopted. If you’ve got a new child, you get 12 weeks to spend adjusting your family to this huge transition. /3
A few notes on our approach: 1. Expecting a child has nothing to do with our hiring decisions, &amp; we do everything we can to accommodate. That’s supposed to be law, but there are small ways (incl self-selection) where it can play a role. We work to be a pro-family workplace. /2
I’d like to share another “unusual” (but shouldn’t be) part of my office policy w/ you all: Parental Leave! Three members of our small team are expectant or new parents in the first 6 mos of my term. In my office, *every* new parent receives 3 mos paid leave - including dads.
We chose to go on the climate offense with the #GreenNewDeal. As a result, climate denial is now a losing position + we got GOP (incl #WheresMitch!) to finally admit that climate change is real + man-made. Now it’s time to go after predatory lending. Whose side is the GOP on?
Really, the biggest, boldest idea (other than war) the GOP has proposed is A Wall. At this rate they’re gonna propose getting us to space w/ trebuchets. They constantly hate, but have 0 real solutions for income inequality, healthcare, climate crisis, racial injustice, etc.
GOP is talking smack about the Post Office (of course, since they have no ideas). The funny thing about that: it‘s the GOP’s own “business model” that hurt them! They forced USPS to prefund pensions decades out (which makes NO sense &amp; no solvent biz does)instead of year to year.
That’s why we pair usury w/ support for a non-profit banking option esp in key communities: aka Postal Banking. Big banks won’t service poor communities unless they make a killing off them - that’s why they charge predatory rates. Doesn’t have to be that way w/ competing model.
“This is crazy!” “Just pay your bills!” “You need higher interest for poor people!” 1st of all, 15% interest is already a TON. Most credit unions are subject to usury law; they’re quite sound. in fact, they’re the few who DIDN’T need a bailout in ‘08. So let’s talk about it ⬇️
There is no reason a person should pay more than 15% interest in the United States. It’s common sense - in fact, we had these Usury laws until the 70s. (Max interest rates are record-high for ppl with excellent credit, too.) It’s a debt trap for working people + it has to end.
New policy proposal dropping tomorrow with a special Senate co-lead 😎 It’s radical, which I always love, and we’re keeping more coins in your pocket, which I also love.
Before we won, climate issues were ranked very low in nat’l voter priorities. Thanks to risk-taking activism, it’s now consistently ranked as a #1 or at least a top 3 issue for many voters. Leadership is often about choice: take the temperature, or change the thermostat.
That’s too bad. The President does not exist above Congress, he governs alongside us. That’s what co-equal means. If he prefers to rule by fiat, he’s welcome to resign and return to the Trump Org tax-fraud fiefdom in the private sector whenever he pleases. Checks &amp; balances ✅
🗣Labor, labor - read all about it! Your Direct Action for today: Don’t take an Uber or Lyft just for the day. (Just today! Cabs are fine! You can do it!) It’s a small but big way you can help all the drivers you’ve met get paid more to feed their families + support themselves.
If your “business model” is based on caging kids, keeping fams in freezing rooms to save on heating costs, and for-profit incarceration, you shouldn’t be in business at all. Caging people shouldn’t be a financially incentivized activity. For-profit prisons should be banned.
It was an honor to meet w/ @mineworkers today, support legislation to fight for their right to healthcare + pensions, and discuss how we can move forward on the right to clean air and water, together. The folks trying to turn us against one another are fighting a losing battle.
What’s funny is that there *are* Dems that do act like the Tea Party- but they’re conservative. They threaten Dem votes to get concessions for a small minority, tried to hand Speakership to the GOP, fundraise $ w/ Mike Pence, etc Progressives don’t do that. And I drink coffee.
For context, this kicks in within days of a typical at-home test working. If you were sexually assaulted (stress delays cycle), took a morning-after pill (throws off cycle), or have an irregular cycle, you‘d have no idea. There are a TON of ways this law ignores basic biology.
“6 weeks pregnant” = 2 weeks late on your period. Most of the men writing these bills don’t know the first thing about a woman’s body outside of the things they want from it. It’s relatively common for a woman to have a late period + not be pregnant. So this is a backdoor ban.
Wouldn’t you think someone who personally lost over a BILLION dollars (“more than nearly any other taxpayer in America”) be vulnerable to shady activity to get out of that hole? If they became the most powerful public servant in America, wouldn’t you want to see their taxes? 🤔
“If another country came in here, blew up our mountains, and poisoned our water, we’d go to war. But industry can.” - @paulajean2020, West Virginia.
Call your parents. 😉
They were illegal in NYC for a long time and never really became a thing after the ban was lifted 😂 Other home things many NYers don’t have in their apartments: washer/dryer, dishwasher, central air. (Saving up for a portable dishwasher was one of the best things we did)
As if billionaires haven’t been influencing policy this whole time? Health corps are why the US is the ONLY highly developed nation w/o universal healthcare. Fossil Fuel execs funded resistance to climate policy. &amp;corp lobbyists are why we don’t have publicly funded elections.
The CDC requires doctors to offer info sheets on vaccines/boosters recommended to patients. If you were born before ‘89, you may need a new measles vaccine due to outbreaks. If you want to know what shots are rec’d for adults, the CDC’s has a list here:
PSA for folks who haven’t had consistent healthcare/doctors: Get your Tetanus vaccine booster! You’re supposed to get them every 10 yrs as an adult - I just got mine bc I didn’t have insurance for a bit. My shot also included a whooping cough booster bc of recent outbreaks.
AKA why GOP donors are losing their minds and throwing money at lame YouTubers and social media content producers to make videos justifying $300 insulin, defending racism as acceptable because “it’s just a joke” and other Conservative Argument versions of Freebird ⬇️
This was always the dream: for people at home + across the country to come together to watch #KnockDownTheHouse w/ community, friends, + family. These moments, making the space and time to talk, are what change our neighborhoods, states, and country. 💕
That a sitting US Senator can say something lacking so much critical thinking + honesty is embarrassing to the institution. If you were a female candidate, maybe you’d be called “unlikeable,” “crazy,” or “uninformed.” But since you’re not, this inadequacy is accepted as normal.
Our extractive, wasteful, fossil fuel economy is posing a direct threat to our own lives. There is a better way: one that’s conscious, just + prosperous. We will not be able to save our planet without first changing ourselves. That is the task before us.
We were so ready for lumberjack life after months of 18 hour days that neither one of us had gotten a haircut in months 😂 it’s also one reason why my hair was always in a bun (It was very nice to see him again after we took a weed wacker to his castaway beard post-election ☺️)
And by bit I mean like 10 words 🤣 trying out here
Just a bit! I made a campaign video in Bengali and it was really fun. Over 200 languages are spoken in my district of NY-14. I can speak 4 (2 are rusty, but it’s like a bike). Picking up a little Bengali is my next goal - we have an awesome community here ☺️
I honestly thought GOP witnesses would be well-prepared, w/ sophisticated arguments for the opposing view - evil-genius lobbyist types. But they’re often sloppy + reaching (not all though). I think if everyday GOP voters saw the witnesses called on their behalf, they’d be upset.
One of the things that genuinely surprised me in Congress is the sheer mediocrity of witnesses called forth by the GOP in hearings. Yesterday they brought in a guy w/ a polka dot bowtie backed by oil lobbyists arguing that fossil fuels are “healthy.” HEALTHY. It’s embarrassing.
Barr needs to resign.
A little motivation mantra for your Thursday morning✨ You got this!
The mediocrity is astounding. How would these guys like it if Gov was 80% female, constantly looking for ways to limit or outlaw condoms + vasectomies, yet had little/no medical context? Sounds crazy? The flipside is what women &amp; LGBTQ+ people have to deal w/ ALL the time. 🤦🏽‍♀️
“The new documentary is worth a watch, no matter your political persuasion.” I’m so glad #KnockDownTheHouse is inspiring people across the political spectrum. At early screenings, even Trump supporters left the film in tears - because it’s about the power of everyday people.
You: Why is my balance so low? Economists: Bc working Americans haven’t gotten a raise in 30 years despite unprecedented growth; &amp; living costs have exploded. Chase: Maybe if you skipped that Dunkin on April 22nd you‘d be able to afford your RX meds. That’s how that works right
The inhumane living conditions in NYCHA are a disgraceful result of Congress’ refusal to fund routine public housing investment for almost 20 YEARS. That $32 billion in neglect means kids are now testing w/ lead in their blood, breathing in mold, &amp; more. And it was preventable.
My community garden plot is doing well! I was nervous checking up on it today, because Congress has been out of session for 2 weeks for district work. I left it with a bunch of watering stakes/bottles and hoped for the best. They blew up! Peep the collard greens! 🥬👀
You are using this as an excuse to stoke suspicion around my Christianity + faith life, @KellyannePolls. The Sri Lanka massacre was horrifying. No one should be targeted for their religion. If you’re so moved, let’s do more to welcome immigrants fleeing religious persecution.
The terrorist attack in Sri Lanka was horrifying. Saying ‘Easter worshippers’ matters bc Easter is the holiest day of the year for Christians, &amp; to be targeted on Easter highlights how heinous the attack was - just as saying yesterday’s #SanDiego shooting was on Passover.
“Corrupt” is a good one, too. I’m curious, how do you spin ignoring and neglecting the largest mass death of people on American soil in decades, @KellyannePolls? After all, the official count of 3,075 people is much bigger than the 64 number your admin clung to for so long.
I chose to use the word ‘incompetent’ when it comes to Trump’s response to Hurricane María &amp; the 3,000 Americans who died on his watch, but that’s only because I had 280 characters. There are plenty of other words too: - Negligent - Inept - Inhumane - Predatory Take your pick.
Hello Ms. Conway, On Easter I was away from tech visiting my grandmother in Puerto Rico, which continues to suffer from the White House’s incompetent disaster response. Are you trying to imply that I am less Christian? What was the point of you bringing this up on national TV?
Happy Sunday everyone - let’s sing! 🎼This LOVE This VOICE This STRENGTH This PEACE This JOY that I have/ The world didn’t give it to me - The world didn’t give it, &amp; the world can’t take it away🎶 Thank you @ResistanceRev for our #GreenNewDeal community celebration yesterday!
Heartbroken to hear of the San Diego synagogue shooting, particularly so on this final day of Passover. We have a responsibility to love + protect our neighbors. The longer the Senate delays holding a vote on #HR8, the more we put Americans at risk.
Civics lesson for the NRA: As much as they may not like it, the Bronx and Queens are part of “the real America,” too. Wild that the NRA is suggesting the voters of NY-14 aren’t “real Americans” bc they don’t think assault weapons in school classrooms is a good idea.
Step 1: Call yourself the “Grim Reaper for socialist legislation” Step 2: Call anything + everything “socialist legislation” Step 3: Profit... (...from $300/mo insulin, fracking pipelines, poisoned water, for-profit prisons, pricing out communities, assault weapons, etc)
GOP already bad-faith attacking “nonviolent offenses.” Clearly if you are looking at CONTEXT CLUES in my thread &amp; limits of 280 chars you know I’m referring to nonviolent drug offenses. Swear it’s like we’re back to encouraging 1st grade readers when it comes to some “pundits.”
To understand how racial injustice works subconsciously in America, all you need to do is watch how quickly + readily some people jump to justify stripping voting rights for millions of people, yet how uncomfortable and fraught that convo becomes when one brings up reparations.
-We “shouldn’t” incarcerate for nonviolent offenses, -We “shouldn’t” have school-to-prison pipelines, -We “shouldn’t” sentence poc more than white people for similar crimes, ...but we do. We’re so eager to talk about punishment, but correcting our injustices is “controversial.”
Many rebut the voting question by saying, “Well, *those* people shouldn’t be jailed.” Glad you feel that way! But the truth is, the US incarcerates more people per capita than anywhere in the world - even more than China. Our system is built to disenfranchise people of color ⬇️
Reminder: - Slavery ➡️ Jim Crow + Redlining ➡️ War on Drugs ➡️ Mass Incarceration - Black Americans &amp; PoC are far more likely to be convicted + sentenced longer than White Americans for similar crimes. - Our system routinely criminalizes poverty + exonerates wealth
To avoid looking completely + utterly out of touch w/ the reality our prison system: Instead of asking, “Should the Boston Bomber have the right to vote?” Try, “Should a nonviolent person stopped w/ a dime bag LOSE the right to vote?” Bc that question reflects WAY more people.
The GOP participates in a lobbyist-friendly campaign to trash the VA, so we tear it up &amp; shop out vet care to for-profit healthcare corps. To reduce VA wait times, we must FUND the VA so they can hire+fill the 48,000 vacancies for healthcare providers for our vets.
Like many public systems, GOP want to rip the battery out + say the whole car doesn’t work, so they can sell it for parts. Fully funding the VA &amp; hiring to fill the *49k vacancies* is a clear path to improving it - not auctioning off our vet care systems to for-profit companies.
I rep one of the strongest concentrations of veterans in NYC. The Bronx VA provides excellent care and community for our vets, who sing its praises. The way to improve VA care &amp; reduce wait times (which can be shorter than priv care!) is by fully funding it - not privatizing it.
Just got back from a few (mostly) unplugged days visiting my abuela in PR, and I see the President is tweeting about me. Just another day at the office! 😊
Before my primary, three women &amp; I agreed to film our journey of trying to run for office without big money. Now, #KnockDownTheHouse hits Netflix &amp; select theaters next week, May 1st. To find or host a local community screening, follow: @knockdownmovie
I’m STILL thinking about that lip sync
As it turns out, Rep. Barr has the same amount of coal mines in his district as I do in mine! Who says Dems and GOP can’t find things in common? 😉
Buildings account for 70% of carbon emissions in NYC. 70%. Today the city embarked on an ambitious, aggressive plan to change that and create a ton of jobs doing so. This exactly the kind of economic + climate action we need.
Words cannot describe how proud I am of the grassroots organizers &amp; officials (including Queens’ own @Costa4NY!) behind this momentous passage by the @NYCCouncil. (Upgrading our buildings to be cleaner and healthier creates a ton of dignified jobs, too.)
The #GreenNewDeal is already changing the country. Here’s what folks didn’t see coming: just by *offering* the resolution to Congress, the ambitious text was made available to organizers+officials across the country. Now, local govs are taking action. First: LA. Today, NYC ⬇️
Many know I take no pleasure in discussions of impeachment. I didn’t campaign on it, &amp; rarely discuss it unprompted. We all prefer working on our priorities: pushing Medicare for All, tackling student loans, &amp; a Green New Deal. But the report squarely puts this on our doorstep.
While I understand the political reality of the Senate + election considerations, upon reading this DoJ report, which explicitly names Congress in determining obstruction, I cannot see a reason for us to abdicate from our constitutionally mandated responsibility to investigate.
Mueller’s report is clear in pointing to Congress’ responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President. It is our job as outlined in Article 1, Sec 2, Clause 5 of the US Constitution. As such, I’ll be signing onto @RashidaTlaib’s impeachment resolution.
If Congress wants to #ProtectTheVA, we shouldn’t starve it + then sell it off for parts, forcing vets into for-profit emergency rooms + to providers who aren’t used to working w/their unique medical needs. We should fight to fully fund the VA + hire to fill its 49,000 vacancies.
Throwback Thursday ⤵️
🤣 Surprise! I know more about West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky &amp; Appalachian communities than they think I do, in no small part bc it’s a valued perspective to me &amp; for coalition-building, so I have it *in my staff!* I suspect underestimating women is the GOP’s kryptonite.
What a truly incredible town hall tonight in the Bronx on protecting + improving veteran’s care. We heard from mothers, Vietnam veterans, VA nurses, advocates and policy experts on the way forward. Thank you @NationalNurses, @NYCVetsAlliance, @VVAmerica &amp; everyone who came!
You know what’s interesting? Last month I invited @RepAndyBarr to come visit us in the Bronx and offer perspective in our MSNBC Climate Town Hall. He said no, because UK had an NCAA game that night. Fair. So I offered to fly him home in time for the game. He still said no. 🤷🏽‍♀️
For those curious, the legislation in question submitted by @BettyMcCollum04:
No one is arguing this. Simply put: I don’t believe in caging kids. Pretty straightforward value. I don’t care if it’s American kids, Mexican kids, or Palestinian kids. I vote against funding it on the US border, too. It would be inconsistent w/ my values to fund it anywhere.
GOP thought they could catch us with a bluff. Now we’ve got ‘em on their back foot stutter-stepping 💁🏽‍♀️
“Even while greed and corruption slow our progress ... true power still rests with the people.“ - @ewarren Couldn’t be more honored and humbled to read these words from a woman I admire so deeply. Thank you, Senator Warren, for your tireless fight for working families.
(YouTube version with captions here:
Climate change is here + we’ve got a deadline: 12 years left to cut emissions in half. A #GreenNewDeal is our plan for a world and a future worth fighting for. How did we get here? What is at stake? And where are we going? Please watch &amp; share widely ⬇️
Our country has a “justice” system that criminalizes poverty + disproportionately targets race, yet routinely pardons large-scale crimes of wealth and privilege. Moments like these tell us it’s less a justice system, and more a class enforcement system. ⬇️
This is a great, substantive dive on the #GreenNewDeal w/ Senate lead Sen. ⁦@EdMarkey:⁩ “When we were drafting the [GND], we looked to FDR’s 1944 State of the Union. He said that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security.”
Surprise!💥 For months we’ve been working on a very special + secret #GreenNewDeal project. Now it’s ready to drop tomorrow morning. Here’s a sneak peek ⬇️
Reminder that we’ve taken progressive organizing straight into Trump country, rallied 5,000 people in the middle of a workday, and can do it again. In time, not a single GOP seat should be taken for granted. Wherever there‘s working people, we can win.🗳
If by “destabilize,” he means “disrupt for-profit insulin schemes bc the discovering scientist freely gave away the patent bc he didn’t want us to price-gouge life saving medicines,” then yes. (PS:#MedicareForAll is @RepJayapal’s bill, not mine - and am I proud to cosponsor it!)
What if a bold agenda rooted in improving everyday people’s lives is part of a winning strategy? What if the choice btwn big ideas+winning elections is a false one that crept up through outsize influence of💰in politics? What if, in a nation parched for change, we were water?🌊
GOP’s getting scared that up close, their constituents will realize I’m fighting harder for their healthcare than their own Reps 🙂
Alternative Headline: Republicans Mad at Government for Doing Its Job
That’s bc I like: ✅ Solar panels 🛰 ✅ Turbines⚙️ ✅ Battery Storage 🔋 ✅ Electric Vehicles 🚛 ✅ Regenerative Ag 🐄 ✅ Jobs + Justice 🏗 ✅ Funding fuel worker pensions👷🏽‍♂️ ✅ Structuring our economy so it doesn’t depend on continuous extraction of working people &amp; the planet 🌎
All too often, “bipartisanship” tends to mean coming together to advance corp lobbyist interests, or raising the military budget ad absurdum. It doesn’t have to be that way. It can also mean building unconventional, yet principled coalitions to end our War in Yemen and more.
“They’re a billion-dollar company because of us. Working-class Americans haven’t been this fed up with their employers since the 1980s.”
One of the ugly aftermaths of 9/11 that is too often ignored is the codified profiling of Muslim-Americans solely bc of their faith. No-fly lists. Warantless mosque surveillance. All of it. To fear+suspect all Muslims due to the actions of terrorists is bigotry. Plain &amp; simple.
Two years ago, Bodega owners across NYC (&amp; cheered by neighbors)shut their shops citywide to protest Trump’s #MuslimBan. Today, that same community is banding together to reject sales of the NY Post at bodegas citywide. This is what real unity (&amp; NYC solidarity) looks like ⬇️
🎶 Ain't gonna let injustice turn me around I'm gonna keep on walkin' / Gonna keep on talkin' / Marchin' up to freedom's land We ain’t gonna let nobody turn us around/ 🎶 Mood: @ResistanceRev Chorus
Thank you, Rep. @DelgadoforNY19.
Thank you for standing up for all of us, Sen. @ewarren.
Thank you Sen. @BernieSanders for recognizing these attacks clearly for what they are.
Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the President’s explicit attack today. @IlhanMN’s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out. “First they came...”
Fox News brought me up 3,000+ times in *6 weeks.* That’s how hard they’re fighting against dignified healthcare, wages, &amp; justice for all; and turning their firepower on the youngest Congresswoman in history to do it. Too bad for them, cause we don’t flinch.
Yesterday at FSC, I asked CEOs about something known as countercyclical capital buffers. Think of it as a “rainy day” rule, so banks must stock up 💰 to prepare for a downturn, so they aren’t caught empty-handed as they were in 2008.
You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes. In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost ALL US domestic terrorist killings. Why don’t you go do something about that?
I’m not going to quote the NY Post’s horrifying, hateful cover. Here’s 1 fact: @IlhanMN is a cosponsor of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. She‘s done more for 9/11 families than the GOP who won’t even support healthcare for 1st responders- yet are happy to weaponize her faith.
Only *one-third* of American children in elementary &amp; middle school can read at grade-level. One third. Yet Betsey DeVos is trying to cut *every* Federal literacy program in the country. Watch @RepJoshHarder point this out + dismantle her argument.
This puts me in danger every time. Almost every time this uncalled for rhetoric gets blasted by conserv. grps, we get a spike in death threats to refer to Capitol Police. Multiple ppl have been arrested trying to harm me, Ilhan, &amp; others. @GOP, what’s it going to take to stop?
Take your rightful seat in history, Dr. Bouman! 🔭 Congratulations and thank you for your enormous contribution to the advancements of science and mankind. Here’s to #WomenInSTEM! 👩🏻‍🔬👩🏾‍💻👩🏼‍🏭👩🏿‍🏫
Kris Kobach is who I brought up in my questioning of Wilbur Ross. He explicitly sought to include a Census Q to harm immigrants. Kobach hired &amp;was funded by open white nationalists on his campaign. His ties are so known that Sec Ross’ own lawyers warned Ross to distance himself.
The GOP, corp lobbyists, &amp; Fox expose their dishonesty every time they claim the #GND “bans cows,” steals people’s farms, takes your grandma’s lunch money &amp;costs $100 zillion. Maybe if they actually did their job &amp; read HRes109, they could avoid embarrassing themselves so often.
The far-right loves to drum up fear &amp; resistance to immigrants. But have you ever noticed they never talk about what‘s causing people to flee their homes in the first place? Perhaps that’s bc they’d be forced to confront 1 major factor fueling global migration: Climate change.
In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents,&amp; refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history. Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse.
“While I am incredibly flattered that [many GOP members] are so enamored w/ a resolution presented by a freshman Congresswoman sworn in 3 months ago... it doesn't seem they've actually read the contents. I would encourage that we don't need Cliff Notes for a 14 page resolution.”
Sec. John Kerry: “Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has in fact offered more leadership in one day or in one week than President Trump has in his lifetime on [climate]." Honored and humbled. Thank you, @JohnKerry.
Justifying psychopathy because low empathy, narcissism, dishonesty + lack of deep emotional attachments are traits that have made a tiny handful of people billionaires (yet land many more people in prison while not getting adequate mental healthcare) is very 2019.
Garden planting success! This is my first time trying a garden like this, so let’s see how it goes. Shoshin approach. Big ups to Ginkgo Gardens for giving me lots of guidance this morning 🌻 Here is their helpful blog for beginners:
I see we’re going pun-for-pun, Rabbi 😂
Only things we *can’t* plant are sunflowers🌻, corn🌽 , mint🌱, &amp; strawberries🍓. Aside from that, the world is our community garden 🌞
Happy Sunday! Excited to say I’m tending to a community garden plot for the next few months :) It’s a 4x4 plot we get to tend to now through Sept. Any green-thumbs out with sage🌱 words of advice? What should I plant? (Ideally at least 1 edible thing but we can do flowers too)
Understand when Jeanine Pirro goes on Fox + rallies people to think hijabs are threatening, it leads to this. Folks who imply we’re “bad” for politics, the party, the country, etc. have no idea the threats we deal w/ because of that kind of language. Talk policy, not personal.
The good news is that we can improve this easily w/ honest reflection. For ex, are certain hairstyles discouraged in your workplace?Why? Can you think of someone who didn’t advance bc of how they spoke? Why? Examine what’s deemed “unprofessional” around you &amp; adapt it to 2019.
We see the perceived “costs” to not code-switching all the time. Can’t tell you how many young people in our community don’t have the confidence they should bc they didn’t grow up learning secondary speech. Their talents get stifled by “respectability,” despite enormous gifts.
Code-switching is referenced a lot in pop culture. It was a big element in a major film last year: “Sorry To Bother You.” If you’re confused about how code-switching is a cultural reality for people of color &amp; communities, read about it. Some accounts:
Next time you‘re told straight hair is “unprofessional” &amp; that speaking like your parents do is “uneducated,” then you can complain about code-switching. Code switching is a tool communities learn when they’re told their voice, appearance, &amp; mannerisms are “unprofessional.”
As much as the right wants to distort &amp; deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act &amp; talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home. It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time.
Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March &amp; Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture &amp; had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up. My Spanish is the same way. These conspiracy mills are 🚮.
Public policy that doesn’t address surging inequality + historic injustice is unsustainable. That’s why the #GreenNewDeal views social+economic proposals (such as healthcare, just transitions for frontline communities &amp; dignified jobs) as part of tackling enviro+climate change.
Today, April 4th, marks the day of MLK’s assassination. His last speech, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” delivered the evening before his passing, is critical to take in. King may have been taken, but he left instructions. Thank you @BerniceKing for your tireless work.
Democracy and civil rights is how we got a country where “feminists do science.” (Also, note how he’s drumming up fear around women’s rights to create suspicion around climate change policy. Tells you a lot.)
Does “live from the border” mean Party City? Fox is really out here doing the most on a budget to make the border look more dangerous than it is 😂 h/t @jacobsoboroff

When your ‘gritty, guy-in-a-diner’ news profile doesn’t go quite as expected 😂 This week’s #GreenNewDeal MVP goes to... ⬇️ 🏆
How on earth could young people, whose: -wages are flat -costs of living skyrocketing -experiencing increased social instability via bigotry, addiction, + violence -expected to live shorter lifespans than previous gens dare question the larger economic forces in their lives?!
On Capitol Hill we wear pink 😉 TY @jvn, @bobbyberk, @tanfrance &amp; @antoni for visiting + helping us push for the #EqualityAct, &amp; be there to watch Congress pass the Violence Against Women Act &amp; War Powers Resolution to end U.S. involvement in Yemen. Justice happens together 💜
Thank you all for visiting me! You made my work day 🤗🌈💕

If you’re a guy in a $ suit that feels some type of way when you see me on TV, maybe you’re limiting yourself to thinking working people’s gain must come at your loss. After all, mega corps have gained at the cost of working people for so long, many can’t think of any other way.
.@chrislhayes was just as excited to host a #GreenNewDeal policy town hall in the BX as he was to get home in time to take his child to gymnastics class. If that’s the scary future feminists want, get SPOOKED bc the future is here and full of great relationships with your dad 👻
People often think strength is holding back tears, or that bravery is checking your life at the door for another day. To me, bravery is the courage to be vulnerable in front of the world. &amp;Strength can be finding the power in your tears. @RepJayapal, you were all power today.💜
You mad bro? 😂
The rent is too high! This #TenantTuesday, we’re shedding light on the loopholes + tactics used to intimidate renters, price out communities, drive up rent, &amp; how housing, real estate, wealth inequality+racial justice are all tied up. The Fair Housing Act would like a word. ☺️
Related: Chelsea Manning has been trapped in solitary confinement for refusing to answer questions before a Grand Jury. Solitary confinement is torture. Chelsea is being tortured for whistleblowing, she should be released on bail, and we should ban extended solitary in the US.

Swing by our office! We’ve barely had time to hang anything up, three of my staffers are expecting babies, and we’ve got a bach pad/warehouse type situation out here. 😩 SOS! (The good news is that people are leaving a rainbow of positive post-its on our wall so that’s cute)
When someone called a fmr Republican Congressman a “moron” at our televised town hall, I shut it down immediately - bc I believe our policies can win on merit, &amp; can be improved w/ productive discourse. You know we’re winning when the GOP resort to vapid, personal insults ⬇️
Hey Rep. Cheney, I see from your dead people comment that you get your news from Facebook memes, but the National Constitution Center + Newsweek are just two of many places where you can clarify your misunderstanding of the history of the 22nd Amendment:
Truly can’t thank you all enough. The more we opt into small-$ giving, the less our system relies on corp lobbyists. In a few hrs, we changed the game for swing-district members who stayed strong under pressure. This is a major move that sends a strong, positive message.✨ TY!
GOP taking every tweet so earnestly, making my point for me. It’s not an argument against the price of a croissant - it’s about the value of human worth. But I guess that idea is foreign to them since their policies treat people as disposable anyway 🤷🏽‍♀️
If one truly cared about reducing immigration to the United States, they would focus on global goals of peacekeeping, humanitariansim, and shared economic prosperity abroad. Resilient people often migrate to the US fleeing war and violence, natural disaster, or extreme poverty.
Croissants at LaGuardia are going for SEVEN DOLLARS A PIECE 😱 Yet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??
We got you, @JahanaHayesCT! Your bravery and bright advocacy for Connecticut families on the floor of Congress deserves every bit of shine 🌟
We are blowing through our FEC goal tonight - $50,000 - in just a few hours. All of it goes straight to cands who stood strong for working people, climate, gun safety, immigrant youth &amp;more. Thank YOU all for proving that a different politics is possible.
Truly incredible: in ~2 hours, we’ve raised $30,000 for 3 bold swing seat Dems. This is politically powerful, bc it shows Dems that grassroots will mobilize time &amp; resources when we choose to act courageously. Crazy, but can we do $50k before midnight?
3rd for today on the tandem is @MikeLevinCA. I sang his praises yesterday, but his gutsy stance against fossil fuel lobbyists and bold work on climate change is seriously worth our support. Let’s go in:
Next, let’s send some coin to @KatieHill4CA! Rep. Hill is a strong, principled fighter on getting money out of politics. Her fortitude is one part of what makes her a great Vice Chair on Oversight. She’s also kept her word on M4A. Let’s have her back:
First up: @JahanaHayesCT. Jahana Hayes is a fmr Nat’l Teacher of the Year and has been kicking butt in Congress. She ran a tough, bold campaign and hasn’t shied away from championing children and families. Let’s go in and have her back:
🚨Hey everyone! Tonight is a VERY important FEC fundraising deadline. GOP is targeting swing Dems already, &amp; their campaigns need early strength. Today I’m going to ask that we chip in what we can 💸 to support some bold swing-seat Dems - all at once:
“3 Mexican Countries.” Just a reminder that these are the same folks who assert their superiority by belittling the intelligence and good faith of others.

The @DCCC’s new rule to blacklist+boycott anyone who does business w/ primary challengers is extremely divisive &amp; harmful to the party. My recommendation, if you’re a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC &amp; give directly to swing candidates instead. Some great ones:
Important thread from @AyannaPressley on the @dccc’s decision to boycott businesses that offer services to primary candidates. She is making important links here, showing how the party’s decision is an economically disempowering one to many communities ⬇️
Solidarity &gt; “civility,” bc you can very civil while arguing for the inhumane + unacceptable. You can be “civil” while locking up kids &amp; drugging them in detention camps, or stripping people of their insulin or civil rights. Civility is abt appearance. Solidarity is abt action.
Fueling discord + scarcity is an effective tool for billionaires + the powerful, bc those are the most effective ways to turn working people against one another. Solidarity, fighting for each other, &amp; addressing injustice is our path to economic dignity.
Some people peddle the myth that undocumented people are free riders. Yet undocumented residents pay TONS in taxes💰to finance public services they can’t/don’t even use. Most don’t get tax refunds, either. Correct this bogus argument. It’s rooted in “welfare queen” stereotypes.
.@hmcghee you CRUSHED it tonight! ⚡️ Make sure you watch the bonus #AOCAllIn Town Hall videos with @FlyingWithSara, President of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO &amp; more ⬇️
Let’s debate, not debase. ✌🏽

Follow tonight’s convo using the hashtag #AOCAllin - the best part of tonight is the panelists and experts we’ve gathered to discuss our possibilities. (Even a Republican came! 🤯)
#GreenNewDeal Town Hall airs in 30 minutes! 8pm on MSNBC. Here’s a sneak peek:
That’s okay - I’ll fight for their right to healthcare anyway.
Thank you for your support, leadership, and collaboration @SenMarkey! Your work has paved the way for this #GreenNewDeal moment, and I am thankful for the opportunity to carry this resolution with you and help present it to the public. ♻️🌍👷🏽‍♂️
Let’s do this! #GreenNewDeal Town Hall w/ @chrislhayes
🎶 Today’s morning jam: @TankandDaBangas’ Tiny Desk via @NPR 🎶 Happy Friday everyone! 🌞
(I do have a soft spot for humor activism. Marie Antoinette also showed up to Secretary Wilbur “Let Them Eat Bridge Loans” Ross’ hearing, as well):
This week marked @cspan‘s 40th birthday, yet THEY are the ones giving US the gifts 😂🎁
Word. But someone’s got to care about growing the Dem base: the thing ppl don’t realize is that the House is where you can build turnout infrastructure to win Presidentials. When we don’t invest in blue-seat organizing in the House, we don’t get the turnout we need every 4 years.
It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me &amp; stoking nat’l division, reported on by @JaneMayerNYer or something
BREAKING: We had labneh
Betsy DeVos “loves” the Special Olympics so much, she wants to cut federal funding for it. She “loves” students so much, she changed rules to make campus sexual assault victims more vulnerable. And she “loves” teachers so much she wants to cut student loan forgiveness, too.
Thank you @MartiGCummings for serving us #BabyShark smile realness today 😂🐬🏳️‍🌈
Thank you for recommending it! Several others had been DMing me on IG about it, but I had lost the name of the app in the sea of messages. When you told me in person I was able to recall&amp; download it. You + those advocates are the main reason why I started captioning when I did!
Watch this video. Abdul is truth-telling. @AbdulElSayed, you need to run for something and join me out here because your voice is needed in these streets!
One of the highlights of my day! Made me want an office pup 🐶 Other highlights: - The middle schoolers who visited me w/ well-researched Qs on climate policy - Voting to rebuke trans military ban (it passed ☺️🏳️‍🌈) - The woman who visits my staff w/ cupcakes came by 🧁 (TY! 💕)
Look at this picture. When you’re looking at this photo, you’re looking at a mirror. This is America. This is Texas. This is our the course of action, the one we chose. I cannot and will not accept it. #EndFamilySeparation&amp; #AbolishICE &amp; #ReuniteFamilies &amp; Stop
(&amp; no to the trolls, not suggesting that this ex. be met with leg - though the quoted tweet certainly could be. What ex. shows is we ALL should ask questions about accessibility in our everyday lives, of ourselves + others. That’s how we figure out solutions, leg or otherwise.)
Ugh, yes! Just last week at home there was a notice posted in my building that the elevators were going to be out for days. The obvious question: what‘s the plan for people who can’t use stairs?? Are they just expected to stay inside for days? This is an infrastructure issue ♿️
I’m gonna RT some of the recommended disability advocates you all suggested, and this from @NyleDiMarco goes first because it truly had me rolling 😂 (There was a huge positive reaction when I started captioning my IG stories - I use @clipomatic to do it, it works instantly⚡️)
I see Betsy DeVos and the GOP are doubling down on their Anti-Everybody agenda by working to cut Fed funding for *the Special Olympics.* The good news? You elected a House Dem majority, so we can halt it. Now: who are your favorite disability advocates to follow? Share below ⬇️
Thank you, @RepAdamSchiff! Honored to serve alongside you as we work to protect our democracy and planet 🌎💪
You know it! 💪
Thank you @AyannaPressley! Your example, sisterhood, and leadership strengthens me (and so many women + girls!) to use my voice too 💕
3,000 Americans died in Hurricane María. The Midwest is drowning as we speak. 100s of Flint families were pumped w/ poisoned water &amp; our water infrastructure is imperiled across the country. GOP thinks this is a joke. They choose to laugh+delay. We choose to lead.
W/ the #GreenNewDeal, legislators, experts, &amp; advocates have spent countless hours poring over details of industrial policy+impact of global temp/sea lvl projections. That’s what you do when you take your job seriously + respect the chamber. This is what happens when you don’t:
&amp; 3:01:47
3:20:29
The GOP’s climate delaying is costing us lives + destroying communities. Iowa, Nebraska &amp; many in the Midwest are catastrophically flooded right now, in one of the 1st major climate change disasters of 2019. A #GreenNewDeal urges us to pursue a plan on the scale of the problem.
Because I encouraged them to vote present, along w/ others. McConnell tried to rush the #GreenNewDeal straight to the floor without a hearing. The real question we should be asking: Why does the Senate GOP refuse to hold any major hearings on climate change?
Like many other women + working people, I occasionally suffer from impostor syndrome: those small moments, especially on hard days, where you wonder if the haters are right. But then they do things like this to clear it right up. If this guy can be Senator, you can do anything.
GOP Senators are using their Congressional allowances to print Aquaman posters for themselves to argue that a #GreenNewDeal saving our nation from climate change is a ‘waste of money’ 😂
We’re prepping for this week’s #GreenNewDeal Town Hall in the Bronx w/ @chrislhayes + @MSNBC! What topics + questions would you like to see discussed on Friday? Let us know! 🌍👷🏽‍♂️♻️ Join us:
In order for us to heal as a nation, we ALL must pursue the hard work of addressing these root causes. It’s not as easy as voting. It means having uncomfortable moments convos w/ loved ones, w/ media, w/ those we disagree, and yes - within our own party, too. It’s on all of us.
He can stay, he can go. He can be impeached, or voted out in 2020. But removing Trump will not remove the infrastructure of an entire party that embraced him; the dark money that funded him; the online radicalization that drummed his army; nor the racism he amplified+reanimated.
This is the REAL conversation we need to have as a country. As horrific as this president is, he is a symptom of much deeper problems. Even foreign influence plays on nat’l wounds that we refuse to address: income inequality, racism, corruption,a willingness to excuse bigotry.
The GOP’s whole game of wasting votes in Congress to target others “on the record”, for leg they have no intent to pass, is a disgrace. Stop wasting the American peoples’ time + learn to govern. Our jobs aren’t for campaigning, &amp; that’s exactly what these bluff-votes are for.
“Banks are acutely sensitive about their reputations because they are in a business acutely susceptible... if consumers vote with their wallets.” Economic activism (ex: the fossil fuel divestment mvmt we saw at Standing Rock, and pressuring business re: assault rifles) works.
Gotta love how the same folks who tolerate+ acquiesce to building a medieval wall along the entire US southern border as a (non-evidence based) solution for a “crisis” that doesn’t exist are now suddenly concerned that pursuing a nat’l response to climate change is “unrealistic.”
The #GreenNewDeal is a positive vision - a roadmap - for our future.
These are flood risk maps for THIS YEAR. The time to have *already begun implementing* a #GreenNewDeal was a year ago. The next best time is now. It’s far less costly to get shovels in the ground now, before disaster, w just transitions, infra investment, &amp; good,dignified jobs.
Folks often try to make this convo abt members from mod, swing districts. We get that those members do what they need to rep. But many members of Congress got there via safe primaries. It’s how many working people, women, + poc folks overcome institutional bias to get elected.
The 🐘 in the room here is big money &amp; lobbyist donors. Our current system incentivizes *all,* no matter the party, to place big donors before voters. No primaries means lobbyist💰will have even *more* influence over policy, bc voters will have one less avenue to pursue change.
The majority of Americans live in safe districts, where gen election isn’t competitive. By stymieing primaries, you deny most voters their best chance at choosing their representative. We also deny the party the opportunity of training up a future bench, something we badly need.
When I ran, the existing Dem tech was so obsolete that we developed our own canvassing app. It was so good it spun off into its own startup ( It’s a shame that innovative technologies proven to work at winning elections won’t be used by our party.
During orientation, @RepJayapal invited me to her place for some boxed soup. We talked about #MedicareForAll &amp; navigating dbl standards. She’s the real deal, a serious policy mind that cares abt people. Pramila Jayapal isn’t just a leader for ‘women of color.’ She’s a leader.
When your bodega cat is also a bachata cat:
Mirror mirror, on the wall Who’s the fairest bodega cat of them all? Mirror: The calico on E Tremont 🏆🐈
!!!
You know, instead of training children, teachers, houses of faith, &amp; concertgoers to prep for being shot, we could just: -Pass Universal Background checks (#HR8!) -Disarm domestic abusers -Mandate safe storage -Ban bump stocks, semiautos, &amp; high cap mags designed to kill people
(As always, shout out to CA’s Rep @RoKhanna for being so on point.)
But his WhatsApp
When we choose NOT to establish healthcare as a right (including mental health!) it spills over + compounds the costs of homelessness, mass incarceration, &amp; police confrontation. None of these issues would be as dire or costly if we prioritized mental health in policy + culture.
Excited to join @LateNightSeth tonight to talk about the #GreenNewDeal! You can catch me here, or if you’re local come to tonight’s Community Board 9 meeting 😉
(For the record, it was a bar stool)
This is a small-big thing, but shout out to TIME and Collier Schorr for getting my skin tone right in this photo. ⭐️ It’s the little things that make a big difference, a lot of people see + appreciate it
This is progress, and there is still work to do. There should not be a for-profit industry behind the detention and incarceration of human beings. The US locks up more people than anywhere else in the world, incl China. For-profit caging shouldn’t be legal in the first place.
Huge update: JP Morgan &amp; Wells Fargo have announced that they will no longer fund private prisons. How did this happen? Through organizing people &amp; public pressure! Everyday folks began paying attention to who was funding for-profit prisons &amp; family separation,+ acted on it. ⬇️
Yes, and this is not just my story - this is true of wide swaths of our entire generation, who are now poised to become a much more influential civic + electoral bloc as we mature into our 30s &amp; beyond.
You know what’s amusing about this whole thing? Our leg staff (who help w Qs) *also* worked in restaurants, grew up in Appalachian trailer parks, and come from immigrant families. Wait until they find out I actually PAY them to do their jobs, coach them myself,&amp; offer feedback.
Last year, I woke up to organize w/ my community &amp; waitressed to make ends meet. Today, staggeringly, I woke up to this. I believe in an America where all things are possible. Where a basic, dignified life isn’t a dream, but a norm. That’s why I got up then,&amp; why I get up now.
Sandy Hook happened 6 years ago and we can’t even get the Senate to hold a vote on universal background checks w/ #HR8. Christchurch happened, and within days New Zealand acted to get weapons of war out of the consumer market. This is what leadership looks like ⬇️
Because “no tax evasion” and “no insurance fraud” don’t quite have the same ring to it.
Your*
Everyone’s last names are hyphenated - so you children take the first names of each of their parents. ex: my dad was Ocasio-ABC, my mom’s was Cortez-XYZ So I am Ocasio-Cortez (When they married, my mom became Ocasio-Cortez too - wives keep father’s name + take husband’s too)
For the curious, in Latinx culture children take *both* their parents‘ names. It’s not a “progressive, new thing.” It’s just how some names work. PR hyphenates, others mark differently. Your last name = the families that came together to make you. AOC is also fine though :)
My last name is Ocasio-Cortez. Full stop. That’s my name. No, you can’t say “Cortez.” I’ve never used that in my life. “Cortez” is referring to someone else. Even if they‘re trying to be rude + wrong, my dad’s last name was Ocasio anyway. (His name was hyphenated too, though.)
By the way: Fox News likes to say my name (incorrectly) as “Cortez,” which I can only imagine is bc that sounds more ‘stereotypically’ Hispanic + probably incites more ‘anxiety’ for them. Pro Tip: My last name is not “Cortez,” just as theirs isn’t “Ingra” or “Carl” or “Hann.”
“How dare they refuse to say their name in a wrong accent &amp; not mangle their own family name so that I can feel more comfortable instead of look inside myself &amp; examine why something as small as *a person’s name* makes me uncomfortable in the first place?? This is an outrage!”
Siri, show me the brand of ‘economic anxiety’ that mocks Americans of color as unintelligent + unskilled, while *also* mocking those same Americans for speaking more languages than you:
If by ‘the Latina thing,’ she means I actually do the work instead of just talk about it, then yeah, I’m doing ‘the Latina thing.’ Unless of course she‘s talking about being multilingual, which we know isn’t a ‘Latina thing.’ It’s a ‘21st century’ thing.
Meanwhile as folks wring their hands over a nonbinding #GreenNewDeal, I spent this AM touring LaGuardia airport + discussing: - Securing solar panels on every roof - Living wage jobs - Electric shuttle fleets - Building for rising sea levels coming in - Centering community issues
Source:
JP Morgan agreed to pay out *$13 billion* over its massive role in mortgage schemes w the ‘08 recession. They also finance major fossil fuel pipelines. It’s big money💵 So maybe they *aren’t* the best authority on prioritizing economic wellbeing of everyday people &amp; the planet.
Next Friday: We’re teaming up with @chrislhayes to bring you our NY-14 #GreenNewDeal town hall from the Bronx, because a better future starts from the bottom up ♻️⤴️🌎 Tune in next week!
A poll tax by any other name...
#GreenNewDeal haters’ plan to address Climate Change:
68% of all NYC public school students are Black or Latino. To only have 7 Black students accepted into Stuyvesant (a *public* high school) tells us that this is a system failure. Education inequity is a major factor in the racial wealth gap. This is what injustice looks like.
White supremacists committed the largest # of extremist killings in 2017. What the President is saying here: “if you engage in violent acts of white supremacy, I will look the other way.” Understand that this is deliberate. This is why we can’t afford to sit on the sidelines.
My deepest condolences, Soledad. Thank you for sharing her important story with us.
This is different than being moderate on policy. I may disagree w/ approach (keeping the ACA as-is w/small tweaks, etc), but at least that’s a policy convo. But to make decisions based on the political efficacy of a bigoted argument gives that bigotry power, &amp; that’s a problem.
We can’t gloss over it, or quietly consider that the “shrewd” thing to do is nominate someone who won’t be subject to bigoted attacks. Morally, we can’t give a pass to this dangerous tactic. But even politically, the Dem base is all the people you demoralize by not standing up.
When “centrists” care more about the GOP base than the Dem base, bigotry gets legitimized. This is *the* playbook. GOP does it w/ virtually every Dem figure who isn’t a white male: otherize, demonize + splinter. It’s vital that we adapt &amp; dismantle this approach, not cow to it.
Gracias a todos lo que me ayudaron hoy a replantar mi zz! 🌱💜 - Shout out to everyone who helped me repot my zz today! They‘re doing great ☺️
I LOVE how fired up our NY-14 town halls get. This is New York City! Getting fired up means you care. I’d never discount the passion and courage it takes to stand up at a town hall. So this was a great moment and an awesome opportunity to have this honest conversation. 💜
The reason people know more is bc Fox News has turned into “AOC TMZ” (no offense to TMZ), so awareness is growing w/ GOPers. @JaneMayerNYer has reported deeply on this propaganda machine + it will be aimed at any Dem they want. Nothing changes that. We can’t be scared by that.
If you want to know what subconscious bias looks like, it’s a headline saying “AOC is underwater with every group EXCEPT women, nonwhites, and 18-34 year olds.” So older, conservative white men are considered “everyone” and everyone else is discounted as an exception. Cool 👍🏽
According to this polling/headline, “everyone hates AOC except most of the country” 🤣
This was the sweetest moment 🥰 Happy St. Patrick’s Day to all tomorrow! 🍀
You can see the whole exchange here: - though I’m happy to engage in this convo more and see how we can better address anti-black racism and reparations specifically
Fwiw this clip is cut out of context + the first 1/2 of the interviewer’s question is cut off. If I recall correctly,she was asking about the challenges some may pose to complicate the convo. This isn’t my take, just offering that they are possible challenges to prep for in convo
The latest Freudian GOP conspiracy theory is that there’s a secret “guy who made me” + that my male chief is “actually” in charge (🙄) They got one thing right. There is a guy who made me. My father. And my Papa raised me to command my own destiny and put patriarchy in the 🚮
Can someone break down the “progressivism doesn’t work in the midwest” thing? - Ilhan reps Minnesota - Rashida reps Michigan - #GreenNewDeal + #MedicareForAll are polling as top issues in Iowa - The progressive message WON in 2016 primaries So what do these folks really mean?
Agreed. We can’t not talk about it anymore.
This WHOLE line of questioning yesterday was abt how Kris Kobach (who’s funded by white supremacists) was deeply engaged w/ Sec. Ross to add a drafted citizenship question to the #Census. Ross’ excuse was Voting Rights. But his story doesn’t add up.&amp; He skirted law to add the Q.
Obama was the first presidential candidate I ever voted for, at 18 years old. The GOP has been calling Dems + healthcare policies socialist my entire voting-age life. My rec is learn how to effectively counter the attack instead of running away every time they call us a name.
I am so proud of NYC youth taking their future into their own hands today with a #ClimateStrike. Young people around the world are beginning to launch climate walkouts to pressure their governments into acting on a real climate change plan for their lifetimes, now.
Daily reminder that we have a **Muslim Ban** in this country made out of the President’s hostility to Muslim people w/ little-to-no supporting evidence, and a Republican Party that tolerates it. There is so much work to do. Repealing the Ban is square 1.
At first, learning about white supremacy can be confusing or challenging. There’s a lot there, + it can be emotionally hard to realize one may have done or participated in something racist in the past (&amp; still may slip up!). That’s okay. The whole point is learning + improving.
WE ALL can play a role in recognizing + preventing spread of white supremacy, especially our white friends. There are lots of community orgs, writers + groups that help people learn to spot white supremacy. @SURJNYC is one in NYC, but please share others:
If we truly want to address the problem of white supremacist violence, we have to learn how to recognize it + how it shows up in our culture. Surprisingly to some, signs of white supremacist culture are NOT easy to spot early for those aren’t aware. Because it’s everywhere.
White supremacists, like many extremists, get radicalized online. There is a well-documented digital rabbithole that young men fall into: they often go in frustrated young people &amp; come out w/a formed hateful ideology. That’s the way radicalization works.
All of these are terrorist incidents. We have a responsibility to understand how white supremacy + online radicalization works, because it is impacting our entire society. President Trump defunded Federal programs designed to fight the spread of white supremacist hate groups.
Friends, Morning (Friday) is Jummah, the weekly day of worship for our community of Muslim friends and loved ones. Be there for them. Check in. Perhaps extend a kind gesture at your local mosque. There is so much fear and hate. We must negate it with active, courageous love.
(“Thoughts and prayers” is reference to the NRA’s phrase used to deflect conversation away from policy change during tragedies. Not directed to PM Ardern, who I greatly admire.)
This is a time of great vulnerability for our communities. We must come together, fight for each other, &amp; stand up for neighbors. Isolation, dehumanizing stereotypes, hysterical conspiracy theories, &amp; hatred ultimately lead to the anarchy of violence. We cannot stand for it.
At 1st I thought of saying, “Imagine being told your house of faith isn’t safe anymore.” But I couldn’t say “imagine.” Because of Charleston. Pittsburgh. Sutherland Springs. What good are your thoughts &amp; prayers when they don’t even keep the pews safe?
Yup. We’re not even debating the citizenship question yet. There is a legal process for adding *any* Q to the US Census. That process takes ~5 years. Changing a Census question, not reporting that proposed change to Congress, and possibly lying about *why* would = Big Trouble.
Cheers for empathy 🥂 Thank you!
This from @AyannaPressley was a powerful moment yesterday, too ⬇️
I know everyone says their committee‘s best, but to watch Chairman Cummings is to take in a study in leadership. He commands universal respect from the both sides of the aisle, because he is tough, fair, &amp; compassionate to *all.* Watch how he swoops in here. I’m taking notes 📝
GOP challenged me in committee, betting on an assumption that I didn’t know what I was talking about. Spoiler: I knew what I was talking about. Keep believing the patronizing trope about “not smart, but her heart’s in the right place.” Makes em underprepare &amp;not see us coming.
We made serious cracks in the citizenship question case, which seriously threatens the Census. You know the questioning is good when the GOP tries to challenge you into stopping, are unsuccessful, and an army of lawyers starts freaking out. Chair @RepCummings saved the day.
IMO what’s going on in the Wilbur Ross Oversight hearing right now is far more explosive than the Cohen hearing.
Here’s the key question: where do bath robes play in all of this? (Also imo quality towels &gt; 50 towels)
This is for a bed and breakfast 😂
TEN? Are you wrapping each limb or something?!
Is Instagram still down? Bc after 2 months almost furnitureless in DC I am trying to take you all on the riveting adventure of getting: a chair 😆 (Also, if you had to start a new apt from scratch, what would be the first 5 pieces of furniture/items you would get? Asking for me)
And before conservatives start whining that I refer to tax cuts (aka revenue cuts) as costs, here’s a reminder that the world recognizes that they are costs too:
Cost of the GOP Tax Scam for the rich:💰~$1.8-2.3 Trillion Cost of forgiving all student loans in America:💰~$1.5 Trillion Clearly where there’s a will, there’s a way. When people say that there isn’t “enough” to do these things, what they mean is they don’t *want* to do them.
Congress’ insider trading problems used to be worse - and the good news is that some laws have been passed to tighten things up a bit. But there’s still a lot of work to do:
Same w/ member pay. Members are paid more than avg - but job reqs 2 residences + we can’t take tax deductions for work costs. No one wants to be the one to bring up increases, so instead ppl take advantage of insider trading loopholes &amp; don’t close them for the extra cash. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Members of Congress often vote to cut or keep their allowances low. It’s a superficial gesture, bc keeping Congressional pay low is what creates the desperation + impetus for good, experienced staff to flee to lobbyist jobs. Raising staffer pay helps get money out of politics.
Real answer: He’s threatened. Since #HR1 strengthens voting laws+starts to get money out of politics, it hurts his job prospects. After all, who knows what could happen w/o the insane problems we see every Election Day? We might actually get government that works #ForThePeople.
Are you making the argument that the bondage, dehumanization, and enslavement of Africans as free labor for white landowners - a scheme upon which the American economy relied - equals good old-fashioned, free-market capitalism? Because if so, I’m happy to consider your point.
*91% of caucusgoers in IOWA* said they prefer a candidate who supports the #GreenNewDeal. 67% of want a LOT of talk about the #GND. The reason so much hand-wringing, concern trolling, + outright attacks are focused on the GND is bc it’s a winning issue, &amp; the lobbyists are mad.
I guess college admissions isn’t that different from elections, where lots of money can buy your spot too. Also an enviro where those who make it despite the odds are suspected to not have “earned” it, not truly belong, or assumed to not be able to perform at the same level.
Running to get a scam bank account opened in your name to own the libs 🏃🏻
The key here is in the advance knowledge. When you *knowingly* do something that you know *in advance* will do harm, and do it anyway, you open yourself up. Companies *know in advance* that climate change will get worse if we keep growing fossil fuel consumption and production.
Actually, in NYC if you’re a bartender and knowingly over-serve to someone, you *ARE* liable for things they do after they leave the bar, because you knowingly put them at risk for $. Its called the Dram Shop Act. It’s a big reason why bartenders cut people off. And it works.
With the way things are structured now, if the banks don’t care, no one cares. They’re simply not incentivized to - no matter the damage to people, families, and the environment. We mostly address issues after the damage is done. But we can’t afford that w/ climate. ⬇️⬇️⬇️
The difference here is that we *already know* abt climate change. We know that more fossil fuels will harm us. Banks know. Fossil fuel cos know. Gov + politicians know. It’s not an accident. It’s cause+effect. We knew DAPL would leak. And we know the next gen is in danger.
Sea walls will have to go up as seas rise. Wildfires to put out. Roads repaved. Nascent technology to explore. Electrical grids replaced. It’s too late for us to not have to deal w/ the impact of climate change. At this point we shouldn’t be debating IF we do it, it’s how.
This, right here, is a problem. Institutions can engage in unlimited financing of fossil fuels, building unstable pipelines + reaping profits, but when the bill comes to clean up oil spills &amp; fix damages - they can conveniently kick the can. So, who will pay for climate change?
Each day that goes by where we turn our backs on Puerto Rico + Hurricane María, we are choosing to starve American people. We are choosing to starve our own citizens, simply because of where *in our own country* they were born. If we do it here, where could it happen next?
The CEO of Wells Fargo said they chose to finance the unstable Dakota Access Pipeline over Standing Rock Sioux objections, because the bank determined it was “worth the risk.” To whom? #DAPL has leaked at least 5x. And we, the public, are left to pay for cleanup+destroyed land.

True. It’s been GOP vs. the people of the United States for almost my entire life
Whoah: the creepy org filing bogus ethics complaints against me just *actually* got hit with one of the biggest fines in FEC history. They “took a $1.3 million donation from Chinese corporation—breaking federal law barring foreign interference in elections”(!!!) - @annalecta
Just because a monopoly business happens to be online, that doesn’t mean it’s good. Facebook may have its own problems, but it’s increasingly starting to look like our society (namely, our democracy) has a Facebook problem.

Yup. Quite a few Republicans lauded now fought MLK Day and participated / were complicit in denouncing MLK as communist. There is a long history of smearing progressives, particularly activists of color, as communist. It’s called Red-baiting &amp; it’s the GOP’s main strategy today.
- HIV/AIDS crisis and demonization of LGBT+ community - Union-busting - Ending the Fairness Doctrine, which launched the polarized media environment we’re suffering from today Why are we not supposed to talk about these things?
Ok great, now talk about Reagan and: - Iran-Contra + - The gutting of our mental health system + - The explosion of homelessness under his watch + - The crack epidemic Maybe instead of insinuating I’ve never read a book, be open to the idea that we’ve read different ones.
Between Tucker Carlson’s defense of sexual assault + calling women “extremely primitive,” or Jeanine Pirro’s bigoted diatribe that hijabi women are “antithetical” to the Constitution, who do you think Fox News will give a promotion to first? 🤔
This is why we advocate for: - Medicare for All - Tuition-free public college - Investing in dignified jobs that build our nation + get us to 100% renewables before it’s too late. These are investments in people, not profits. Corps aren’t incentivized to ensure people’s health.
Even billionaires are acknowledging it, folks. When 40% of Americans can’t afford basic needs, or a $400 emergency, the problem isn’t unique. It’s systemic. That’s not good for anyone. Even billionaires know they can’t shield themselves from this kind of perilous instability.
I’m a believer in privacy - which means I reject unlimited, unchecked, warrantless surveillance. Tracking consent should be given freely (aka not holding a service hostage for it) - whether it’s a gov or a corp. Warrants, &amp; their requirements, are supposed to mean something.
The best part about the GOP-Fox propaganda machine is that Republican Congressmen actually believe + consume it uncritically, get duped themselves, which lead them to make statements like this 😂 (Another one thought I got paid for the KDTH Netflix doc too- I didn’t get a dime!)

Rep. Omar, a survivor of war, is one of the most effective voices right now at cutting through the authoritarian foreign policy tendencies of this administration. She nails it here. You can see why she gets targeted ⬇️
Bill! Bill! Bill!
Ah yes, because we‘ve all drawn upon the rich inspiration of American leaders who‘ve inspired a nation in crisis by saying, “No, You Can’t.”
In case you’re curious about where the sudden flood of bogus ethics “complaints” &amp; fake “scandals” are coming from, GOP troll groups are filing a ton of random claims. There’s already a dark-money operation aimed at me just 2 months into my job - happy #InternationalWomansDay!🤗

This is like the “wrap it up” box but for climate delayers 😂 Shout out to Rep. @JoeCunninghamSC
I find it revealing when people mock where I came from, &amp; say they’re going to “send me back to waitressing,” as if that is bad or shameful. It’s as though they think being a member of Congress makes you intrinsically “better” than a waitress. But our job is to serve, not rule.
Where’s the outrage over the 23 GOP members who voted NO on a resolution condemning bigotry today? Oh, there’s none? Did they get called out, raked over, ambushed in halls and relentlessly asked why not? No? Okay. Got it.
Paul Manafort getting such little jail time for such serious crimes lays out for the world how it’s almost impossible for rich people to go to jail for the same amount of time as someone who is lower income. In our current broken system, “justice” isn’t blind. It’s bought.
In case you saw the conspiracy theory running around, conservative groups have now taken to spamming us by filing bogus ethics complaints so that Fox News can report on “alleged,” untrue scandals. This is how the misinformation machine works, folks.
Hidden gem: Rep. @katieporteroc on Financial Services 💎 She consistently delivers incredible lines of questioning (and frequently adds a dash of humor). ⬇️
These disturbing, authoritarian practices are what we’re funding with every dollar given to DHS &amp; ICE with 0 accountability ⬇️

Apparently the answer is or close to: $0
Today’s 🔥 from Rep. @LaurenUnderwood:
Remember when all the left did was finger-wag &amp; make cynical assumptions, instead of showing up despite an imperfect moment? When the main defense is rooted in telling others how to feel - especially when you’re not from that community - it’s not solid ground. I ask other Qs.
Literally nowhere did I say that. If you’re not going to read and listen to what I’ve been saying all day, then misinterpret + jump to a wrong conclusion about it, then I don’t know what to tell you. You’re not going to falsely pit me against her, or anyone else for that matter.
The way we reject the 0-sum idea that some communities win at the cost of others is by using opportunities to address issues intersectionally - to highlight that Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all bigotry serve the same ends &amp; that we prevent division by championing one another.
I respectfully disagree. The disproportionate treatment is what is exacerbating the situation. I think this moment is a good opportunity for an intersectional approach.
None of this is “whataboutism.” Racism and bigotry of all forms is inextricably linked. When you don’t address them as a system and attempt to pick them apart as though they are distinct and separable issues, eventually the thing that gets advanced is white supremacy + classism.
The entire PREMISE of a wall is not based in fact. It’s based in a racist + non-evidence based trope that immigrants are dangerous. Yet some Dems are willing to “compromise” &amp; spend BILLIONS on a trope because we’ve accepted some kinds of racism as realpolitik in America.
If we’re so concerned about implied tropes, why aren’t we concerned about this one? Where was the concern last week when 26 Dems voted for a GOP amendment to expand ICE powers rooted in the racist + false trope that Latino immigrants are more dangerous than US born citizens?
As it should always be, this is about putting impacted communities first, centering their concerns, and ensuring that they have real say in a just, open process that lets the people whose lives will change ask real questions, get real answers, and have a seat at the table.
Cool cool - this is fine, totally acceptable and normal rhetoric; legitimized by the presence of members of Congress and the President. 👍🏽 Let me guess: no apology is necessary here, because they’ve simply been “misunderstood.”
You know, when I got to DC I was told that it’s considered “off-limits” to report on a member’s family, love life, etc. Unsure why that consideration is suspended for me. (Also for those who ask how I learned to handle pressure,try being the only daughter in a Latino household)
The Bishop’s tweet is corrected for context here. Still wondering what the standards are for what merits a resolution and what doesn’t.
Thanks for clarifying the source tweet. Treatment is still completely different.
“I always thought that if more good people had concealed carry permits,then we could end these Muslims before they [unintelligible].” This was just this weekend at CPAC, the conference attended by the President and members, to 1000s. Where’s the resolution against Islamophobia?
This is disappointing to see. Just last week there was all this hubbub over an untrue mischaracterization that I was threatening primaries based on pro-ICE votes. Yet there seems to be no problem at all with a zero-tolerance stance for simply asking about US foreign policy.
If you ever wonder why the GOP targets Pelosi more than Schumer, or Waters more than male committee chairs (despite having equal or similar positions of power) this is part of the reason why ⬇️
It means not invading an entire nation without end. Doesn’t mean “do nothing,” it means perhaps we could have leaned more on the larger role of other agencies (intelligence, state dept, diplomatic teams, etc) before Congress decided to invade a nation without a concrete end plan.
I think that our decision to enter unlimited engagement in Afghanistan, particularly through the AUMF + Congress’ abdication of power + decision-making w/ passage of the AUMF, was a mistake. Other options: targeting the network itself, limited engagement, non-intervention.
If House leadership is creating a standard &amp; committing to calling a resolution for every incident - whether it’s the Congressional Black Caucus, CHC, etc, then thats a clear way to address the issue &amp; we can all understand. But if they’re not, I think it’s valid to ask why not.
It’s not zero-sum + we have a serious responsibility to listen to communities when they feel pain. Where I struggle is how we deal with that pain: the “how” after the “what.” I also fear brooding resentment,bc PoC are *always* promised that ppl will “work harder”w/o commitment.
And don’t even get me started on misogyny. If we called resolutions on sexist statements, a good chunk of Congress would be gone. To jump to the nuclear option every time leaves no room for corrective action. So I ask *everyone* that we practice calling in before calling out.
I often think about how I work with white or male allies when they say something insensitive. The 1st thing I do is pull them aside + say “hey, you may not be aware of X thing regarding Latinx people, but here is the history and it’s hurtful. If you want to learn more, read Y.”
“Calling out” is one of the measures of last resort, not 1st or 2nd resort. We do it when repeated attempts to “call in” are disrespected or ignored. And I believe that Ilhan, in her statement a few weeks ago, has demonstrated a willingness to listen+work w/impacted communities.
In this administration + all others, we should actively check antisemitism, anti-blackness, homophobia, racism, and all other forms of bigotry. And the most productive end goal when we see it is to educate and heal. It’s the difference btwn “calling in” before “calling out.”
It’s not my position to tell people how to feel, or that their hurt is invalid. But incidents like these do beg the question: where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he’ll “send Obama home to Kenya?”
One of the things that is hurtful about the extent to which reprimand is sought of Ilhan is that no one seeks this level of reprimand when members make statements about Latinx + other communities (during the shutdown, a GOP member yelled “Go back to Puerto Rico!” on the floor).
(But honestly we shouldn’t have been in either, and we should end the AUMF now while we’re at it)
Afghanistan War* my apologies
Or now, even with a disastrous choice like Elliot Abrams at the helm (a man guilty of crimes related to Iran-contra, including misleading Congress) - it still seems like critiquing US interventionism is taboo. History shows that making some questions “unacceptable” is a mistake.
I remember a time when it was “unacceptable” to question the Iraq War. All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP &amp; Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee.
I‘m curious if Rep. Vargas will further explain his stance here that it’s unacceptable to even *question* US foreign policy. Plenty of Dem members have asserted that discussion + debate on this issue is fair and merited. Is this stance a departure from that?
Shout out to this very NY display of love in the neighborhood yesterday 😂
Sending you, Rachel, and Baby Carl all the love, strength, and support in the world.
Thanks for taking the time. I’m thankful we could share a compassionate and productive conversation that hopefully lays the groundwork for future dialogue.
Thank you Sen. @LuisSepulvedaNY!
“I believe health care is a right and people should be paid enough to live. Those are offensive values to the GOP. But this ravenous hysteria—it’s really getting to a level that is kind of out of control.”
I need to admit something to you all. Frankly, I don’t know how my environmental reputation can recover. Today... I wrote in a book... made out of PAPER. 😱 Apparently using present technology means I can’t fight for new jobs, investing in infrastructure, &amp; renewable energy. 😉
With New York’s notorious closed-party primaries and calcified political machines, fusion voting has been one of the few bright spots that allows independent NYers to vote their values. There isn’t a single good reason to eliminate it.
I will have you know my tía was very upset that the ny post insulted her minivan 😂 If they saw how many goldfish snacks were in this thing they’d say I was killing the ocean too
You ran into one of the best parades in NYC: the St. Pat’s For All parade in Sunnyside, Queens! This parade began as a demonstration for LGBTQ+ inclusion in St. Patrick’s Day festivities. Launched by @Dromm25+activist Brendan Fay, St. Pat’s for All is a core tradition in NY14☘️
According to the GOP, when poor + working people advocate for themselves, we shouldn’t listen bc they’re “irresponsible.” Yet when higher incomes fight for working people,we shouldn’t listen bc they’re“hypocrites.” How about we fight for the right thing bc it’s the right thing?
#GreenNewDeal sign spotting at this year’s St. Pat’s For All parade in Sunnyside! ☘️ 🌎 💚
The Post put the fact that I get into cars (while proposing a plan to invest in better car technology) on their front page 😂 Pack it up folks, the Pulitzer’s been decided. No one can rival this kind of hard-hitting journalism
I’m pretty heartbroken that there isn’t more denunciation of this outward and blatant expression of bigotry and Islamophobia by a state party. IMO those who stood up against anti-Semitism a few weeks ago should also be calling out the Islamophobia here, too.
I also fly ✈️ &amp; use A/C Living in the world as it is isn’t an argument against working towards a better future. The Green New Deal is about putting a LOT of people to work in developing new technologies, building new infrastructure, and getting us to 100% renewable energy.
When you’re trying to justify to yourself + others that we should ignore one of the greatest threats to humanity and imperil all children by denying, deflecting, and delaying action on climate change, you say ridiculous nonsense like this.
And for those wondering, you can read a bit about our staff here:
To learn more about this topic, I recommend reading MLK’s “Why We Can’t Wait” or his essay: The case against tokenism, by Martin Luther King Jr:
- Does the program make selected individuals feel lucky just to be there? - What’s the curriculum? - Big one: Is the org actively learning + adapting their processes based on experiences w/ program members? -What is the org trying to learn and what internal weak spots does it ID?
In my opinion, it’s all in the execution: - Why is the program being implemented (bc current lack of diversity looks bad, or bc you’re actively trying to cultivate talent?) - Does the program put people in positions of consequential decision-making power or are they just around?
We have Black staff. We don’t parade them around to show the world how diverse our team is, and use that as some kind of evidence of the absence of racism. That’s what tokenism is.
When racism becomes acceptable on a partisan basis, and official GOP groups begin to use it to demonize communities, it puts real people in danger. @IlhanMN, I am sorry these threats are being targeted on you. Praying for your safety.
Yes, I dispute it. It’s tricky to nail down exactly what happened when reporting on closed-door meetings. I did say Dems voting to expand ICE powers were creating a list, but not for primaries. It’s the MTR vote list that GOP and immigration advocates alike can use to lobby.
We can have ideological differences and that’s fine. But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed door meeting.
Mind you, the same small splinter group of Dems that tried to deny Pelosi the speakership, fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it, &amp; are now voting in surprise ICE amendments to gun safety legislation are being called the “moderate wing” of the party.
If you’re mad that I think people SHOULD KNOW when Dems vote to expand ICE powers, then be mad. ICE is a dangerous agency with 0 accountability, widespread reporting of rape, abuse of power, + children dying in DHS custody. Having a D next to your name doesn’t make that right.
#MomsDemand &amp; #MarchForOurLives activists, who flew in from across the country, were watching from the gallery, crying + confused. I ran up to them *during the vote* and explained that the gotcha amendment pinned gun safety against immigration advocacy. Its intent was to divide.
What I DID say was that I had to go back to my district &amp; share the MTR vote to explain why a pro-ICE amendment was slipped into a gun safety law. Maybe they’re mad bc I don’t believe pro-ICE expansion votes should be cast in the dark, and people deserve to know what happened.
“At [DHS immigrant detention] facility, children recounted being held down for forcible injections, which medical records show are powerful antipsychotics and sedatives.”
Again, didn’t threaten a primary. I was upset that 26 Dems forced the other 200+ to vote for a pro-ICE provision at the last min without warning. Because I think an agency that pins children down + forcibly injects them w/ antipsychotic drugs shouldn’t be given more power.
What I love about this tweet is that it embodies something we desperately need right now: public imagination. When we focus on imagining and debating new possibilities of what we want to accomplish, instead of relentlessly fixating on limitations, we build the will to do more.
.@RepJoshHarder is awesome to work with 👍🏽
No problem! Thanks for taking my replies into consideration. There’s a ton of press inquiry volume so we can’t always get to everything, but we try as much as we can!
This is the one we’re inquiring about!
Update 2: @USPS is on it! That was oddly riveting. We’re fixing mail! Solving problems! If you‘re in the Bronx, you know how big a deal the mail issue is here. This is big stuff people!!
Update: Calling the @USPS to figure out why my Morris Park constituents are only getting mail once every 2-3 days! This look like a systemic issue. We’re on the case y’all 🕵🏽‍♀️
The cases we can help with the most are cases regarding federal agencies and programs: immigration visas, social security, military service members, EPA, Post Office, etc.
Spending a few hours today doing calltime. But instead of calling donors, I’m calling constituents to personally follow up on casework they’ve brought to our office, and give them progress updates myself. Getting big money out of politics means your Reps can do more of this.
”...so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." /4 - President Theodore Roosevelt, “Citizenship in a Republic,” 1910.
”...but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause;who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly...” /3
“...could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming...” /2
This moment made conservatives so mad. In the larger context of this video, I was talking to young girls about President Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena”: "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds... /1
It’s not all about elections, though much of it can be. It’s also about slowly creeping member positions to be more conservative, tradeoff communities of color, or weaken important legislation - no matter your party.
There are plenty of means of targeting beyond campaigns. One is procedural targeting on the floor, AKA more tough MTRs like the one we were discussing in mtg. Or targeting by way of advocacy, AKA getting a ton of constituent lobby days, crushing your office with phone calls, etc.
Why would a DC insider, given anonymity for a quote of their liking about a specific member in closed-door meeting, stretch the truth? Gee, I don’t know. It’s almost as though DC is a place where people are motivated by many different things.
I didn’t say that they were putting themselves on a list for primaries. I said that by Dems distinguishing themselves by breaking off on procedural MTR votes, they were inadvertently making a list of targets for the GOP and for progressive advocates on their pro-ICE vote.
How is anything I said a lie? Rep. Khanna did in fact ask Cohen the question, and Cohen implicated the President and his son in criminal conspiracy. If you take issue with Cohen’s testimony, perhaps that’s a good reason for us to call in further witnesses.
Folks are trying to argue it, but it’s what happened. I am stating what transpired at the hearing, as reported by Rep. Khanna:
My staff + I come to decisions through robust discussion + debate - we operate as a team. They are also intro’d at community events, bc I want constituents to grow familiar w/ the people picking up the phone when they call. As an educational organizer, I view it as development.
ICYMI: Rep. Khanna got Cohen to testify that Don Jr. is the “second executive involved in criminal conspiracy.” His line of questioning was a very big deal. (He also happens to be a progressive Rep that rejects corporate money!) ⬇️
Ayanna has too many incredible qualities to count, but the fact that she picked the name “A Team” for her staff is 👌🏽 (We‘re still in the market for a clever team name!)
Republicans are calling HR1 a power grab. @AyannaPressley had the best rebuttal: “Yup. You got us. We’re grabbing the power back for the people” instead of corporations.
We’ve actually introduced legislation to this effect: #HR1, For The People Act. But members who rely on corporate and dark money (aka a lot) have been fighting to water it down or defeat it altogether. My “bad guy” questions were actually for the Oversight hearing *on* HR1!
Teamwork makes the dream work ✨
The more you chip in to fund Reps who don’t take corp money (even if it’s $5, $10, or $27) that’s less time they spend dialing for dollars &amp; more time they spend in committee. I sit through committee hearings in full. They often last hours - but that’s hours each day *learning.*
Total bravery from @RashidaTlaib as she reminds the nation that tokenism *is* racism
I guess WSJ Editorial Page takes pride in their ignorance of our nation’s history of slavery, Jim Crow, &amp; mass incarceration; willful doubt on the decades of science on climate change; targeting of indigenous peoples, and the classist, punitive agenda targeting working families.
To be fair, the hearing yesterday went 9 hours and there‘s little/no time to eat. I did the same thing afterwards 😂
GOP defensively say, “we’re not scared of dancing women!” yet proceed to use footage of me dancing “with the color drained to make it look more ominous.” 🤣 Spoiler: The GOP *is* scared of dancing women, because they fear the liberation of all identities taught to feel shame.
People think it’s a joke when folks say we have to work 2x as hard for the same seat. Whether you believe it or not, the upside is when we do get here,we’re used to being held to a diff bar. To being doubted. To getting new hoops thrown @ us last min. So we know how to perform.
I wonder if after yesterday’s hearing conservatives still think my staff is “overpaid.” 😉
On the job*** Agh
I always entertained law school, but couldn’t afford it. So now I’m learning in the job :)
“At the end of the day, people here think that their intentions are gonna save them, but the actual decisions you make matter. We’re not gonna get out of this through incrementalism. We need moonshots.”
Thanks! I really appreciate that. We need to acknowledge the people who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make it happen. @OversightDems staff w/ my staff were double-checking info requests I had just minutes before my turn. I’m truly inspired by their selfless commitment.
Thanks! Bartending + waitressing (especially in NYC) means you talk to 1000s of people over the years. Forces you to get great at reading people + hones a razor-sharp BS detector. Just goes to show that what some consider to be “unskilled labor” can actually be anything but 😉
Welcome to @OversightDems.
By reposting his creepshot. Got it. Being creepy to own the creepers 👍🏽
👍🏽 ok so amplifying the creepshots is okay, got it Just like the journo tweeting the photo of my backside was okay because that one was sent to him too, right?
What’s this then?
a) it would help if it was funny b) a former Coast Guard member literally got arrested plotting to kill me last week and Republican journalists have been paying stakeout photographers to take pictures of me going inside my house, maybe read a room c) the tweet is still creepy!
Also: in before “It WaS a JoKe”
When you’re a guy that’s so unaware of his own creepiness that you tweet this from your own account as if it’s normal and not stalkerish at all 👍🏽
😂😂😂
Tonight a dude was creepily (and obviously) taking a picture of me while pretending he wasn’t and I had to break his imaginary fourth wall and say “Hi! I’m a person! This is weird!”
Our faces say it all.
Imagine attacking a Jobs Guarantee by saying ‘people prefer to earn money.’ ???
In fact, wages are so low today compared to actual worker productivity that they are no longer the reflections of worker value as they used to be. Productivity has grown 6.2x more than pay:
As a person who actually worked for tips &amp; hourly wages in my life, instead of having to learn about it 2nd-hand, I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live. A living wage isn’t a gift, it’s a right. Workers are often paid far less than the value they create.
I’m just gonna put you down as: “haven’t even read the proposal I (apparently) have an opinion on.” Here’s a link to the actual resolution text if you ever decide that you’d like to inform yourself on it:
I understand difference of opinion, but dark distortions of position help no one. GOP knows our actual proposals are popular, grounded, + difficult to refute, so instead they invent hysteric kiddie versions to make it easier for themselves. I bet most haven’t even read the GND.

In case you missed it, while the GOP is calling paying a living wage “socialism,” a Republican Senator full-on quoted National Fascist Party leader and Hitler ally Benito Mussolini like it’s a Hallmark card. ⬇️⬇️
The GOP is so disconnected from the basic idea that people should be paid enough to live that Fox actually thinks me paying a living wage in my office is “communism.” So the next time GOP screams “socialist,” know that’s their go-to attack for any common-sense, humane policy.
Climate delayers aren’t much better than climate deniers. With either one if they get their way, we’re toast.

It’s pretty sad that people think low Congressional staff pay is a good thing. Low pay a big reason why money in politics is a problem - you can make a lot more money becoming a lobbyist &amp; setting up a relationship w/ one, since the actual job doesn’t pay enough. Domino effect.
A lot of people commenting don’t know how Congressional salaries work. Each member is given a set amount that they disburse. GOP has refused to increase budgets in years to give hard-working staff a raise, which means people helping to run the country are getting paid $30k/year.
Leadership starts with our choices. That’s why I decided that no one on my staff will make less than $52k/year. It’s likely one of the highest entry-level salaries on the Hill. We pinch pennies elsewhere, but it’s worth every dime to pay a living wage.
Yup. If you don’t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis. Until then, we’re in charge - and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats.
“The Green New Deal agenda is both feasible and affordable.” -Jeffrey Sachs As conservatives wag their finger and call me dim on econ, a flood of economists have been verifying the #GreenNewDeal‘s sound policy credentials. The GOP talks about flatulence.

Our future is imperiled, our economy is fragile, and frontline communities are vulnerable to major threats from rising sea levels to lead in our water. A #GreenNewDeal is a common sense, moral solution to fix these issues with the urgency they demand.

Billionaires paying to put up anti-progressive propaganda in Times Square is like the obscenely rich version of the scene where Michael Scott points to the Bubba Gump and saying “This is it, this is the heart of civilization, right here.” 😂
Few things effectively communicate the power we’ve built in fighting dark money &amp; anti-worker policies like billionaire-funded groups blowing tons of cash on wack billboards (this one is funded by the Mercers). (PS fact that it’s in Times Sq tells you this isn’t for/by NYers.)
‘You’re a millionaire funded by billionaires... and what they want you to do is scapegoat immigrants instead of talking about their tax evasion.’ Whoah. The direct, relentless clarity of this exchange is 🔥🔥🔥.
You look fab! 😎💕
Journalists are sharing stories about where I live the same day it’s shared that myself + others were targeted by a mass shooter. All this paired w/ amplifying unvetted conspiracy theories. It’s reckless, irresponsible &amp; puts people directly in danger. This isn’t a game.
The conspiracy machine is in full effect &amp; it’s been disappointing to watch professionals get duped + amplify unvetted Medium posts as truth, treating journalism like it’s a high school Livejournal rumor mill or something. No, I don’t shadily pay my boyfriend. Come on &amp; VET. ⬇️
While the right keeps screeching on calling everything “socialism” (as nations w/ univ healthcare + better work standards enjoy better health &amp; work life than Americans), they happily cheer on an authoritarian President &amp; defend the destruction of American Democracy. ⬇️
Sorry, didn’t get the latest memo after 1,000 experienced + qualified journalists of all stripes were let go w/o warning a few weeks ago and still looking for work: are we still pretending that hires like these are evidence of a meritocracy?
Folks handling the failed deal treated community w/condescension+disdain for their legitimate concerns. I warned early to any &amp; all that surging NYC costs+failing subways are creating major political forces to be reckoned with. But I don’t know what I’m talking about, right?🤷🏽‍♀️
There was little in the fuzzy proposal that guaranteed jobs for actual NYers, yet lots of hard concessions from the public. Queens saw how the FoxConn/Wisconsin disaster is working out - a $4.5 billion nightmare - &amp; asked Qs. The response? “This is above you, you won’t get it.”
Or that a technology giant of big-brother-esque potential was selling (notoriously flawed &amp; racially biased) facial recognition technology to ICE while trying to move into 1 of the most immigrant-dense areas of the world? No, it must be because I’m dumb.
There’s no CHANCE that the speculative insider real-estate buys that were creating immediate spikes in rent in one of the most rent-burdened communities in NYC could have possibly been unpopular?
There’s NO WAY that this deal - one of the biggest giveaways in state history - could possibly have been bad, right? Surely there can’t be anything wrong with suddenly announcing a massive restructuring &amp; pricing out of a community without any advance notice or input from them.
Frankly, the knee-jerk reaction assuming that I “don’t understand” how tax giveaways to corps work is disappointing. No, it’s not possible that I could come to a different conclusion. The debate *must* be over my intelligence &amp; understanding, instead of the merits of the deal.
Not sure how many pundits talking about Amazon even read the deal or where it was going. $500+ million of the deal was *capital grants.* $2.5 billion in tax breaks. It’s fair to ask why we don’t invest the capital for public use, + why we don’t give working people a tax break.
Bright spot: Held 1-on-1s w/ constituents today at our local @nypl branch. We try our best to provide crayons, markers, + books at our events so kids can create &amp; read while we work with their parents/guardians. After one convo this AM, a constituent’s daughter gave me this 💜
‘You say you love your children, but you are destroying our future.’ Our sea levels are rising. Droughts are worsening. Wildfires are spreading. Storms are coming. There’s precious little time left. We must mobilize our economy around a #GreenNewDeal before it’s too late.

More like, “I’d like to order 25 pizzas. I made up this $300-off coupon + demand you take it, and if you want to talk about it at all I’ll leave.” Queens: Where did this coupon come from? $300 is too much. Who gave this to you? This is weird. Them: I TOLD YOU $300 OFF 25 PIZZAS
You can’t separate marijuana legalization from the injustices of the War on Drugs. If you do, those who profit from private prisons can get another payday w/ marijuana. $ is a justice issue. Communities decimated by mass incarceration need to see investments w/ legalization.
“I didn’t need to do this” is admitting this isn’t an emergency at all. “I didn’t need to do this” means he’s faking a crisis.

Come for me all you want, but my job is to make sure that people are protected in society. Someone’s got to look out for the people our system is leaving behind - esp now, when most of the wealth created is going to fewer people, those left behind are the majority of Americans.
Is that culture of “strict performance” why Amazon workers have to urinate in bottles &amp; work while on food stamps to meet “targets?” “Performance” shouldn’t come at the cost of dehumanizing conditions. That’s why we got rid of sweatshops.
Amazon touting “jobs” (has anyone fact-checked where this 25k number even came from? How many were promised to be local hires?) ...but they refused to even consider hiring union when we insisted labor be part of the conversation. Union jobs are a key ladder to the middle class.
.@JoaquinCastrotx and I aren’t going to let the President declare a fake national emergency without a fight.
This deal wasn’t a simple tax break. It was $3 BILLION dollars. When the community wanted to negotiate, Amazon said “all or nothing.” They bailed when they didn’t get 100% of what they wanted. Google came into NYC just fine. Amazon wanted to be FoxConn:
Yeah I’m laughing @ this. Amazon was not coming to my Congressional district, had no concentrated outreach to us that I’m aware of, yet w/ no effort I defeated the richest man in the world? Doesn’t add up. Story that’s not being told: the local community organized to reject it.
It wasn’t going to be built in my district. It was supposed to be built in NY-12.
Actually this cal designation is a permission so he can have access to my Google Cal. Congressional spouses get Gcal access all the time. Next time check your facts before you tweet nonsense.
Amazon is paying $0 in taxes on $11+ billion in profit. $0 for schools. $0 for firefighters. $0 for infrastructure. $0 for research and healthcare. Why should corporations that contribute nothing to the pot be in a position to take billions from the public?
Plenty of companies (even large ones) move to NYC without needing an unprecedented $3b tax giveaway that isn’t extended to other local business owners - just look at Google, for example. Deals have to be fair. This is what happens when they’re not:
I think so. Grassroots community members led + organized the whole effort. Wouldn’t have happened if they weren’t there.
Anything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers &amp; their neighbors defeated Amazon’s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world.

I often reflect on @AyannaPressley‘s words: “people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.” @IlhanMN is a Somali refugee. She has felt the ravages of war. Watching her question Trump’s envoy to VZ, who pled guilty to several Iran-Contra crimes, feels like justice.
Bringing the BX to DC!
Apparently this is a normal practice, and people don’t bat an eye. The first few people in line are guaranteed a seat in a given hearing. This was the hearing for marijuana banking laws. Lobbyists and those who can afford it pay people to hold their spot so they get in 1st.
Shock doesn’t begin to cover it. Today I left a hearing on homelessness &amp; saw tons of people camped outside committee. I turned to my staff and asked if it was a demonstration. “No,” they said. “Lobbyists pay the homeless + others to hold their place so they can get in 1st.”
Reminder that their plan = no plan. Why? Because for billionaires, things are already going fine.
Don’t mess with our future. When it comes to climate, it’s all our lives at stake. The younger you are, the more consequences you’ll see. It’s life and death for us. And we will fight like it.
If you want to read more, here’s a starter:
Do you really think these increasingly regular &amp; horrific wildfires &amp; droughts are a coincidence? That growing regularity of “100-year floods” is an accident? We are losing our homes &amp; loved ones *now.* 3,000 Americans died in María. And GOP doesn’t even care enough to try.
We are already feeling the early nightmares of climate crisis, &amp; the GOP is doing nothing to stop it - as they have for years. I’ve been reading docs all week about how much people knew about climate + when. They knew early. &amp; Their goal has been to sow doubt this entire time.
Trust me, I like ice cream way too much to do that. (I also like visiting my family in Puerto Rico too much to “ban airplanes”) Maybe if the GOP did their job for once &amp; read a piece of legislation, they’d see that communities + jobs come FIRST, not last, in the #GreenNewDeal.
Disagree. Progressive Jews in my community have been engaging me in private in an effort to not create infighting. Progressive Muslims in my community are concerned w/ being falsely tagged as anti-Semitic. If we can’t reconcile those things via process then nothing will get done.
Lots of people here proclaiming to be “woke” trying to police communities on what they are/aren’t allowed to be upset by. I’m proud @IlhanMN raised the issue of lobbyist 💰 in politics &amp; equally proud of her sensitivity to communities. Both are possible.
Unlike this President, Rep. @IlhanMN demonstrated a capacity to acknowledge pain &amp; apologize, use the opportunity to learn abt history of antisemitism,+grow from it while clarifying her stance. I’m also inspired by Jewish leadership who brought her in, not push her out, to heal.
Why is it so controversial to say that when children die in an agency’s care and there’s no accountability, they shouldn’t have their budget expanded? People need to wake up. Trump’s not building a wall. He’s building detention camps for kids. And we’re falling for it.
It just appeared one day. Some mothers came by &amp; left 2-3 encouraging notes on my plaque. We left them up, bc it was great to read those little encouraging words every morning. Soon, more post-its came. It became a little ritual for the public, so we left stacks out for people.
RIP our post-it wall :( We were told it had to be taken down... So we moved it inside instead 🤗
“MLK used to teach, “cowardice asks the question, is it expedient? And then expedience comes along and asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? Conscience asks the question, is it right?“
“There is a wide gulf between the political center + the moral center. What is different now is that the moral center — what is right — is popular. So they yell “socialism!” “Venezuela!” “extremism!” ... to spread fear to protect a discredited political center.” - @RevJJackson
There’s no reason to be afraid of lawmakers if everyday people are being respected, protected, and taken care of. Now, if financial companies are engaging in predatory practices and ripping off working/middle class families &amp; the poor, then yes, there will be an issue.
‘Central to @AOC’s campaign has been rejection of corporate💰, closing off a traditional avenue for industry influence on Capitol Hill.’ ”The fear is, it's like going in to talk to the FBI, anything you do or say can be used against you,” said one lobbyist for a major bank.”

Finally, the reason we scope out with a resolution is bc I am not here to say that only one member of Congress will solve a global crisis. Think of the GND Res as a “Request for Proposals.” We’ve defined the scope and where we want to go. Now let’s assess + collab on projects.
And part of what the #GreenNewDeal says, at last, is that Flint wasn’t an accident. The folks dying in West Virginia aren’t an accident. The Bronx having one of the highest child asthma rates isn’t an accident. It’s a structural failure to care, &amp; treat these communities fairly.
The pipes in Flint weren’t a market failure, they were a social failure. It was a failure to see the people in Flint as important as the WH. Those decisions were predicated on a legacy of racism + dehumanization of the poor. The enviro issue of water is how that was expressed.
For far too long, ideas like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to climate change. While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer. The pipes in Flint weren’t a “market failure.”
“Climate change is not a market glitch to be fixed through pricing... but part of a dire social crisis.” The GND Resolution’s purpose is to *define the scope* of a climate solution. Now, from investing into battery tech to fixing water pipes, we can draft projects in the plan.
Sure, ‘mobilizing the economy to save our planet from irreparable global catastrophe’ SOUNDS nice, but will it play well in the Midwest? 🤔
One of the biggest ways predatory financial actors get away w/it all is manufactured shame around personal finance. When working people aren’t paid a living wage, they become easy prey. Private credit score cos also have v little accountability,but huge power in people’s lives.
It does not mean the treatment + presumption of guilt before a verdict. It does not mean we aim for the most punitive punishment. It means that in the eyes of the law, we treat everyone the same. That’s far from what our current system does. And that’s why it must change.
As a result, our system is “innocent until proven guilty” only for the rich &amp;“guilty until proven innocent” for the poor. To borrow from @ZephyrTeachout, the RADICAL rule of law is the idea that in the same scenario, our courts would treat a billionaire the same as a Bronx teen.
All too often, our criminal justice system - from tickets to convictions - is treated as a game, where the one racks up the most “points” wins. Paired w/ foolish criminalization of marijuana, poverty,etc, it wrecks chaos on people’s lives + stagnates communities for generations.
Rikers Island is in my district. Due to Census law, people incarcerated at Rikers are counted as my constituents (instead of at their home community). Changing policy is about changing how we treat people, &amp; we have an obligation to hold our criminal justice system to account.
Full text here: When I talk about the GND, this is what I’m referring to - nothing else.
There are multiple doctored GND resolutions and FAQs floating around. There was also a draft version that got uploaded + taken down. There’s also draft versions floating out there. Point is, the real one is our submitted resolution, H.Res. 109:

“This is my time. You don’t run this Committee, Mr Whitaker. You don’t run the Congress of the United States.” Do NOT sleep on @RepRaskin, y’all. He’s among the best.
Also a good moment to note that in the wake of the Equifax scandal, privatized credit scoring is a dice game &amp; the credit score system is very broken too. If only someone could do a Financial Services hearing about that 🤔
It’s pretty wild that the GOP can’t decide whether they’re going to run with the conspiracy theory that I’m secretly rich, or the exaggeration &amp; mockery of my family’s struggle after my dad died during the financial crisis. Instead, they decide to defy logic and run with both.
This stuff is really sad. The GOP is so intellectually bankrupt that they no longer engage to debate issues in good faith, but instead seek to lie, distort, name-call, target, &amp; destroy people/communities w any means possible. It’s a virus and a race to the bottom.
The right has gotten increasingly desperate w/spreading targeted rumors about me lately. Someone made up a meme that led to @snopes disproving this: (Also, I had to live alone in my family’s apt after my dad died, so the eviction lie is especially bad)
jay smooth gets it more than most people in DC do ⬇️

That Bronx @CWAUnion worker meeting I tweeted about this week? The corporation they were holding accountable tried to break up the union &amp; pass a decertification vote. Dumped $ into demoralizing workers + turning ppl against each other. It didn’t work! The workers won 113-57.💪🏽

You look great! 🤗
Thanks! The full clip is here:
You can watch the full 5 minutes of questioning here:
Rep. Stefanik, this is not a critique of women across the aisle, but of the serious inability for GOP to elect + support women. You yourself have taken your party to task on this - in fact, you called it a “crisis.” I’m happy you’re trying to fix it:
The fact that my candidacy &amp; win was unlikely enough to generate excitement around its novelty proves my premises exactly. Congress has been ~80% male, disproportionately rich, &amp; deeply unrepresentative of the American public. Wins like mine *should* be more common.They aren’t.
One my favorite parts of last night: air-fiving @rosadelauro across the aisle at the celebration of women in Congress (btw, majority of whom are Dem). GOP has major+concerning problems electing women. Out of the *36* new women elected in 2018: - GOP elected: 1 (ONE!) - Dem: 35
Earlier today we had our second Oversight hearing of the 116th Congress. It was about voting rights and the role of money in politics. I asked the expert witnesses to indulge me in a small game. Here’s what happened ⬇️
Why should I be “spirited and warm” for this embarrassment of a #SOTU? Tonight was an unsettling night for our country. The president failed to offer any plan, any vision at all, for our future. We’re flying without a pilot. And I‘m not here to comfort anyone about that fact.
Just wait until they find out about the Golden Rule
My other tips: - Start incorporating thrift, consignment &amp; second-hand clothes in your wardrobe (host a clothing swap w/ friends for a no-spend option) - Walk, bike, &amp; use public transit more often - Bring your own bag/coffee mug. It’s okay if you forget, 1x/week is still a win
Yesterday I visited a school assembly w/ teens in Queens. One of them asked, “What can WE do to combat climate change?” 2 recs: - Skip disposable razors+switch to safety razors - Give your tummy a break! Skip meat/dairy for a meal (easiest is bfast, I do banana &amp; peanut butter)
None of it
The best comment on this thread: “I Cant Believe It’s Not Racism” 🤣
I’m so excited for @staceyabrams, and I’m excited for all of us - it’s a blessing to hear her insight every time. If you’re skipping watching #SOTU tonight, be sure to tune in afterwards to watch her. ☺️
👀
Thank you for an awesome meeting today, @rubendiazjr - and for taking the time to give a run-down on the current state of affairs in the BX &amp; your vision for its future. Shout out to your staff too, they gave a phenomenal rundown on everything from NYCHA to public schools!
Spent tonight w/ @CWAUnion workers in the Bronx organizing for better work. Did you know that the spray painted neon on NYC roads mark gas lines &amp; other critical areas? Those skilled workers are paid little, &amp; can be on call 24h w/ little sleep. Does that sound safe to you?
🤣 with those dang green Starbucks straws in the cups too, can’t miss a brand moment

This is what being a woman in politics looks like: Disagreements aren’t labeled as differing opinions. They’re labeled as one’s knowledge being ‘inadequate.’ As a reminder, I’m not the one who testified about Big Pharma under oath to Congress. It was an expert witness.
It’s the honor of a lifetime to serve w/ my colleagues under the leadership of @RepCummings on Oversight and @RepMaxineWaters on Fin. Services. Every day I know I’m blessed to represent our community in the nation’s capital. And I will forever be grateful for the responsibility.

I’m proud to announce that my #StateOfTheUnion guest will be @AnaMariaArchil2. Ana Maria is the NY14-er who famously jumped into the elevator with Sen. Flake to elevate the stories of survivors everywhere. She‘s living proof that the courage within all of us can change the 🌎.
The average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70% rate. The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would, though.

It was an honor to share such a lovely and wide-reaching conversation with you, @jeremycorbyn! Also honored to share a great hope in the peace, prosperity, + justice that everyday people can create when we uplift one another across class, race, + identity both at home &amp; abroad.
Respect the hustle. 🙌🏾🍪🙌🏿🍪🙌🏼

I’m happy to hear this film is having an early impact on everyday people. Can’t wait for the world to see it.
Northam must resign, and those who try to help him stumble past this deserve scrutiny. If you can’t understand how painful + eroding this is to American society, let alone the state of Virginia, take some time to read up this weekend. To start, try “Between the World and Me.”
Other Brooklyn officials on the scene: @RepJerryNadler @RepJeffries @bradlander + more. Everyday New Yorkers &amp; organizers have also been gathering outside the facility for watch shifts, and to show the people inside that others are paying attention and trying to get to them.
This is a horrific example of how mass incarceration is a moral scourge on American society &amp; should be addressed immediately. BX organizers are holding watch shifts outside the facility. TY @NydiaVelazquez for being responsive to ALL your constituents, incl this emergency.
Love it! Good luck 💪🏽💜
Y’all aren’t ready for NY-14’s #StateOfTheUnion guest! Here’s a hint: I just picked up this gift for them at our very own Lockwood Shop in Jackson Heights 😉
💜🏳️‍🌈 if we want a country where all people are accepted and loved, we have to name and rectify where we historically haven’t so we can act to do so now. (Also - sorry I said “cisgendered” instead of the correct “cisgender.” I’ve learned and am growing too✨)
Someone call Pandora Boxx because last night the lid came OFF
It’s hard for them to admit, but a wall is not what Americans want &amp; never has been. In recent Pew polling, almost 60% of Americans oppose a wall. A *record-high* 75% of Americans say immigration is good for the US. The only radical hostage-taker here is the Republican Party.
This is nuts - even I had no idea about this.
Big Pharma companies often say that drugs “need” to be expensive to fund research. What they don’t tell you is that they use *publicly-funded research* for expensive, privatized drugs. This week on Oversight, @RoKhanna and I exposed how this scheme works:
Nothing Amazon has said or done - including selling facial recognition technology to ICE &amp; its intent to fight against worker unionization - would lead us to believe it could be a good or healthy neighbor for NYC.
Yep. Our offices are flooded with bigoted calls too - so much so that we have to put energy into searching for actual constituents. We forward all the threats to Capitol Police to build files. For all those who think your bigoted calls + digital threats are anonymous: Enjoy!
Thank you, @keithellison! ✨
This week I conducted my first-ever line of questioning at an Oversight committee hearing, which focused on the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals. Here’s what happened ⬇️

The Republican Party’s best and brightest is back at it today, I see
Fun fact: Committee Seating Assignments are not self-selected, + can be determined by a # of factors. @AyannaPressley, @RashidaTlaib &amp; I wound up as seatmates and I’m very excited about it. 🥰 (I also 💜 being desk buddies w/ @BenMcAdams &amp; @JenniferWexton on Fin Services!)
For what it’s worth, I don’t think expanding public imagination is a “new style.” It is a return to the Democratic Party that went to the moon, passed the Civil Rights Act, + strove for the Great Society. It’s the politics of courage vanquishing fear;aspiration over desperation.
Tweets have receipts, @thealexvanness 🧾
Shout out to @rosadelauro for her tireless leadership on bringing #PaycheckFairness to a floor vote, along with the organizers and members who have lobbied to make it a top 10 priority for the majority!
And by the way, it’s “Congresswoman.”
“This bartender” has served in a Senate casework office, organized &amp; educated 1000s of young people, earned relevant degrees w/ honors, worked on field campaigns, and the only reason I wasn’t told to run for city council was because I was consistently told not to run at all.
If “the wage gap is a myth” as some allege, then workplaces should have no problem with workers disclosing our salaries with one another 😇
Why don’t people ever tell billionaires who want to run for President that they need to “work their way up” or that “maybe they should start with city council first”?
There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what is happening to our country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water down or sugar-coat the rise of hate crimes.
We’ve got more solidarity in our pinky fingers than any one of those payasos 🤡
Whoever is paying this “Veteran NY Dem Strategist” is getting totally fleeced 😂
The last photo in this panel 😂 it’s like @GerryConnolly and I are in a road trip buddy comedy or something
Thank you, next 🙂
Here’s my first podcast episode as a Congresswoman! Joined @briebriejoy, @ryangrim for a conversation on what the first few weeks have been like. I also picked the brain of fmr Rep. Brad Miller (N Carolina), who sat on Fin Services during the ‘08 crisis.
"You've got councilpeople who've been waiting 20 yrs for that seat.” That broken mentality, that public office is something you wait in line for, instead of earning through hard organizing, is exactly what voters want to change. Shows you how disconnected some folks here are.
We cannot allow the financing of misinformation campaigns to shape our democracy. We can disagree on policy, but climate change is real. Period. Proud to have joined @chelliepingree on this letter asking for greater responsibility to our democracy and planet.
Be a fierce woman who can do both ✨
It was great to be able to watch this at the same time as everyone in there and join you all from afar. Our goal is to open up the political process to all people, to show what it takes, and communicate that no matter the outcome, you can run as a service to our nation. 🇺🇸
💜
One of these days, I hope people realize that the idea that ICE should be scrapped isn’t so crazy after all. ICE jails children in for-profit detention centers funded by private equity grps. Kids are dying w/ 0 accountability. If that’s not totally broken, I don’t know what is.
This photo is what happens when you get so, SO close to the point, but still miss it anyway
Curious how the right is so quick to fact-check clear rhetorical devices to comprehend the real cliff we face in environmental disaster, yet is oddly silent on fact-checking the President’s clear material lies about immigrants as children die in DHS custody w/ 0 accountability 🤔
Just did. Thank you for your treasured work, @AuschwitzMuseum.
To protect justice, #WeRemember the lessons that apply today &amp; always ⬇️
¿Por qué no los dos? 😉
Classic example is asking an innocent person “when was the last time you hit your dog?” They say, “never!” But the frame was invoked. A lot of journalism is subconscious - almost all good public communicators know that, for better or worse. &amp; That’s the real tea right there 🍵
I do think it’s important to note that questions advance certain frames. What 45 *does* understand is that if he can get media to invoke his narrative enough, people will start to believe or operate in it, regardless of truth. Perfect example is the caravan.
Ok, I laughed at this
Got it! Look forward to joining you all sometime (for what it’s worth, I think we use social media very differently as well. He’s got more of an “man yells at cloud” thing going on 😉)
Also: not only does making this comparison because we’re both “good at social media” a) sound out of touch, but b) papers over the real concerns: Trump’s demonization of immigrants, governance-by-plutocracy, love of authoritarians, and endless stream of indictments in his circle.
Thanks! 💜
Today is #HolocaustMemorialDay - a day where #WeRemember not only the atrocities that result from the contagions of hatred + anti-Semitism, but also the fortitude of communities that continue to be impacted today. A great read for today: Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
You’re doing great, @RepMaxRose! As always, we let the people show us the way 😂 Tootsie roll is all in the knees
When you don’t address human bias, that bias gets automated. Machines are reflections of their creators, which means they are flawed, &amp; we should be mindful of that. It’s one good reason why diversity isn’t just “nice,” it’s a safeguard against trends like this ⬇️
It is truly not okay that posts like these are the everyday reality in the United States, and that some consider the notion of changing it for the better as “controversial” or “divisive.” Our “normal” is not normal. A better world is possible, and it will come if we work for it.
This clip was made at the very beginning of our journey - before anyone knew what was happening. It’s wild to see now. cc: @jubileefilms
For almost two years, a mom followed several women as we ran for Congress. I was one of them. Due to complications from the gov shutdown, I’m sad to say I’ll miss @jubileefilms’ premiere of Knock Down the House. This film was made, with love, for people:
(To clarify, some may have dropped a sentence here or there - but she was one of the 1st to substantively pick up my campaign + didn’t dismiss it. She was one of the only reporters to recognize &amp; take it seriously, thanks to her local reporting + expertise on Queens politics.)
Public radio is great! As is @ProPublica, @frontlinepbs &amp; a great deal of other incredible outlets worth our support. Fun fact: after @TYTPolitics, @brigidbergin at @WNYC was the first to ever write about my campaign - almost a year before my primary win.
Quote tweet got deleted, but - I believe workers should enjoy more of the wealth they create, &amp; that democracy belongs in the workplace, too. GOP believes people should be paid the lowest wages possible, no matter what they produce, so billionaires can scoop up the difference.
If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies, anti-trust, corruption, and ways to address it, I recommend checking out @ZephyrTeachout. She literally wrote the book on it.
The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally &amp; economically unsustainable. We can’t simply accept the cliché that “journalism is dying.” Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too.
Most platforms currently have 0 incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information. In fact, FB *paid* for info tied to conspiracy theories on those demanding for accountability. It matters. Soros was the 1st to get mailed a bomb last year.
Gonna keep it 💯: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies &amp; concentration of ownership. Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism. W/o a wide range of independent outlets &amp; the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble.
Just passed your name along. Wishing you lots of luck and support in this time 💜
I would thank it, but it was never useful anyway. 🚮
What a committed little cub you have! 🐯 Please tell her that I am so proud of her hard work, and that I’m excited to see her up there one day too!
Our issue platform is so strong, Fox basically turned into a nonstop anti-me channel for the last 6 months and *still* managed to lose their home advantage. 😇
I will tell you something most of the country probably already knows: @SpeakerPelosi does not mess around. ⬇️
🤣
One could say the offer... ... came out of left field 👀 (Can you risk censure w/ a bad pun? Asking for a friend 😂)
For the right-wing who are rolling their eyes and thinking I made a mistake by crediting flight attendants (since they aren’t fed workers), know that I meant exactly what I said. This morning, the FA union said they would mobilize to support Fed workers.
I am so proud of the air traffic controllers, flight attendants, &amp; workers who, through their organizing, should be credited for their role in ending the shutdown. Dems only have the House (for now), so we must rely on the bravery + organizing of everyday people to push change.
“America’s first political theorists took these truths to be self-evident: that a person could not exercise political liberty if he did not possess a modicum of economic autonomy, and that disparities in wealth inevitably produced disparities of political power.”
Please tell your daughter that I love her platform and when she gets here, we can start a ‘Care for People’ Caucus together! 💫
This is what swiftly cutting through nonsense looks like. Bravo @ChrisCuomo
Who watches the watchers? @jacobinmag, apparently!
In my 1st speech on the Floor, I warned about shutdown stress on NYC air traffic control. Now LaGuardia is grounded. Do you understand the economic + social impact of grounding flights because two people are insisting on a project *now* that the majority of Americans oppose?
I went to the Senate yesterday w/ my colleagues to witness who was voting against reopening govmnt. I watched them huddle &amp; look around. They know this is on them. GOP Senators should be scared for their jobs in 2020 after voting to imperil so many others’ livelihoods now.
Can confirm that this is the inner monologue that happens in a every remote interview 😂 Ayanna has the best game face. Can’t wait to see it in full effect on Oversight :)
I am criticizing the rationale of saying we should trust a questioned source paper because of a standing friendship and X admin, bc neither preclude the possibility of revolving door politics - if the tweet read as though I was going after @jasonfurman specifically, I apologize.
Revolving-door politics doesn’t care what admin a person worked for. The truth is, many folks come to govmnt to collect a title, &amp; leave to collect a lobbyist check. WaPo itself touched on this by covering the Harvard Orientation. You’re legitimizing that by citing this study.
But don’t worry, he’s friends with the author so it’s fine
💜 we’re feeling the love out here. Thank you everyone for your supportive gestures - it makes a huge difference, and the positivity helps our whole team stay courageous.
While the White House drags us into the past by holding people hostage for a wall, New York is showing what a different future looks like by passing a statewide DREAM Act for NY families ⬇️
If the point of fact-checking is to enforce some objective standard, why would @GlennKesslerWP use a Walmart-funded think tank as reference material for wage fairness? That’s like citing the foxes to fact-check the hens. Here’s 4 Geppettos for your contested Pinocchios 👨🏼👨🏼👨🏼👨🏼
According to @LindseyGrahamSC, the President failing to condemn neo-nazis, forcing thousands of federal workers to go to food pantries,&amp; risking all their credit scores is whatever, but not letting the President march down the House Floor until we pay people first is “a new low.”
Good. The State of the Union takes an immense amount of personnel, security, + planning by federal workers. They need to get paid to do the work. IOUs don’t pay the bills. Forcing people to work while they’re still waiting on past checks wrong. #PayThePeople and we‘ll proceed.
For too long, we’ve been told “no” to a substantially better future - that the America that went to the moon, pursued the Great Society &amp; electrified the nation is no longer possible. I disagree. Instead, let’s break past our self-defined limits and redefine what’s possible.
I also love that such an Official TV News Network™ called him “policy guy” as his official title. What are they trying to do, compete with the Daily Show? Or is Fox News actually just elaborate, postmodern performance art? Have we been misreading it this whole time??
Wait, there’s more 🤣
Tempted to frame this and put it on my desk 😂
🔥
You shouldn’t need a Bible to tell you to protect our planet, but it does anyway. (h/t to @RELEVANT mag for source excerpts that I adapted for the previous tweet)
“Genesis 1: God looked on the world &amp; called it good not once, not twice, but seven times. Genesis 2: God commands all people to “serve and protect” creation. Leviticus: God mandates that not only the people, but the land that sustains them, shall be respected.”
Nope :)
Is it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality?
Can’t wait to do a Twitch 101 class with House Dems so we can finally get the Super Smash Bros Town Halls we’ve all been waiting for 😂
Noted &amp; appreciated. I’m worried that false equivalency btwn open conversations+ a regime’s actions diminishes the threat of authoritarianism while eroding the validity of legitimate viewpoints, &amp; then before we know it well-paid climate deniers are invited on Sunday news shows.
Me: “I don’t think billionaires should concentrate wealth while employing people who are sleeping in cars working a zillion hours to survive.” Next day: “That will be TEN PINOCCHIOS to Ocasio, ‘zillion’ is not a number and I found someone who sleeps in a tent, not a car.”
(Also, for what it’s worth - I meant to say hookworm*)
If we didn’t laugh, we’d cry
If we truly love this country, we will choose to see and address all of it. Including Lowndes County, Alabama. ⬇️
Bingo. That’s one aspect of histrionic coverage: the notion that discrediting the messenger can discredit the message. I spoke about this just yesterday in a public conversation w/ Ta-Nehisi Coates. You can watch the whole exchange here:
This reinforces lazy tropes about women leaders in media: - Older + seasoned, but unlikeable - Passionate, but angry - Smart, but crazy - Well-intentioned, but naive - Attractive, but uninformed or gaffe-prone It’s unoriginal, lazy, and men don’t get the same either/or coverage.
And here’s the @nypost not only running with the false quote, but adding an angry photo to boot: This is how news hysteria develops out of nothing at all.
In a shock to no one, @politico is also running with the misattribution as well. Here’s what actually happened: I was asked a question on a late night show and answered with the word “zero.”
I actually didn’t say this, so while I know “brown women cursing” drives clicks, maybe you accurately quote the whole exchange instead of manipulating people into thinking I said this sentence instead of just the word “zero.”
It’s wild that some people are more scared of a marginal tax rate than the fact that 40% of Americans struggle to pay for at least one basic need, like food or rent. Imagine if we focused positively, away from fear of the former toward solving the latter.
As a reminder, Jason Chaffetz is the guy who thought your healthcare costs the same as a T Mobile bill, so I wouldn’t exactly call him the foremost expert on the financial stressors of everyday Americans.

“There is no documented historic precedent” for the action needed at this moment. -United Nations @IPCC_CH Report “Meeting this goal demands extraordinary transitions in transportation; in energy, land, and building infrastructure; &amp; industrial systems.”
For some reason GOP seems to think this is a gaffe, but it’s actually a generational difference. Young people understand that climate change is an existential threat: 3,000 Americans died in Hurricane María. The UN says we’ve got 12 years left to fix it:
To creating opportunity for all people, saving our planet from climate change, and ice cream! 🍦✨
“The root justification [for marginal tax rates] is not about collecting revenue. It is about regulating inequality and the market economy. It is also about safeguarding democracy against oligarchy.” - Emmanuel Saez &amp; Gabriel Zucman
Excited to be back as a Congresswoman - thanks for having me, @StephenAtHome!
Proud to join this year’s #MLKNow celebration at Riverside Church with @jemelehill, Ta-Nehisi Coates, @common, and more. Tune into the livestream now:
The odds of me making over $10 million in one year while serving in public office are probably as slim as the odds of the GOP ever understanding what a marginal tax rate is. But if it ever got to that, I’d be happy to contribute more for our bridges, teachers, and firefighters.
Lemons into lemonade 🍋🤗
It was great popping in and chatting with you all 👾 thanks for inviting me!
Tomorrow in Harlem ⬇️
If you’d like to use this as a good moment to support the queer community, there’s a charity twitch stream going on for @Mermaids_Gender:
Lastly, we wouldn’t need to talk about bathrooms at all if we acted like adults, washed our hands + minded our own business instead of trying to clock others. Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom w/ a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.
This stuff infects some Democrats, too. Because in our overall discourse, nonviolent protest somehow gets deemed as not “civil,” yet stripping women’s rights or incarcerating children on the border doesn’t receive the same characterization. What’s up with that?🕵🏽‍♀️
Just look at the marginal tax rate discussion. The right’s biggest strategy against my marginal tax rate proposal isn’t to argue against it - it‘s to lie about it, and imply that it’s a tax on all income, bc that helps their characterization of me as a “crazy/dumb“ Latina woman.
If you notice, on the right they’ll flatly call people blanket terms, and even make things up. And I don’t mean trolls - I mean their biggest commentators + TV figures. This is different from criticizing a specific take you disagree with, or pointing out discriminatory patterns.
This has deeper consequences, bc as we’ve seen w/ narratives advanced by the right, they have trouble recognizing intelligence in people they disagree with. This is what bias looks like: for some ppl, small mistakes mean they’re not “serious,” yet others are forgiven for worse.
Let’s dig into “gravitas,” bc it’s an ambiguous word, selectively applied. Ever wonder how expression that’s feminine, working-class, queer, or poc isn’t deemed as having “gravitas,” but talking like an Aaron Sorkin character does? 🤔 Men have “gravitas,” women get “likeable.”
News Flash: Medicare for All &amp; equal rights aren’t trends. When people complain about low turnout in some demos, it’s not because communities are apathetic, it’s bc they don’t see you fighting for them. If we don’t show up for people, why should you feel entitled to their vote?
Why do people think they can mess with Bronx women without getting roasted? They act as though our borough hasn’t been perfecting the clapback game since the Sugarhill Gang 🤣 y’all just found it on Twitter

There are a handful of opportunities for members to address the House Floor. The most common + accessible one is “Morning Hour,” which happens each day Congress is in session. Morning hour speeches are limited to 1 minute, so members try to fit in what they can.
Our freshman class has so many incredible members. Joe Neguse is exceedingly kind and extraordinarily thoughtful. His life story, like so many in their own ways, embodies all that is possible in America. Watch this and you’ll see why he’s so great ⬇️
Be nice everyone! :)
I believe this is called a “paradigm-shift” 😉
It wasn’t for senior Dems, it was for everybody! 🙂 (a fair amount of freshman were there, too)
LA teachers are bringing new meaning to “Dance Dance Revolution” 💃🏽🕺🏾

Gotta love it when the folks calling activists getting arrested to advance equal rights “snowflakes” turn around and get offended by things like coffee cups + razor commercials
Yep! Each Congressional term gets a new schedule set by the majority. You can check where we are here - but next week’s District period has been cancelled due to the shutdown (this is hard on all new members, who still need to set up our home offices):
We have district work periods - our jobs aren’t just to vote in DC, but also require us to be rooted in our communities to oversee constituent casework and community outreach. The work schedule is roughly 4 days DC / 3 days District x3 weeks, then 1 full week in district.
Oh. My. Goodness. Did #WheresMitch wait until House members had to leave DC for their district weekend to show up? 😱 AND he’s calling votes on stripping women’s rights before he’s calling votes on reopening government! He’s hiding. ¡Qué cosa!
“Like the work of Kehinde Wiley, these photographs evoke the imagery we are used to seeing in the halls of power, but place people not previously seen as powerful starkly in the frames.” A truly breathtaking project. You can see all the portraits here:
Thanks for passing our message to the Senate Floor, @SenJeffMerkley! If you find Sen. McConnell, tell him we’re still looking for him. Thousands of Federal workers are being forced to show up without pay, but he doesn’t seem to be showing up for work to reopen gov.
🤣 “What is my life” is one common thing that could be said about both my life a year and a half ago when I was campaigning from a restaurant w/ ~300 Twitter followers and now
As I say *in the clip you posted* we WENT to the majority leader’s office - he was absent. So we decided to drop letters off at almost every place he could run (including the GOP break room). At what point is @FoxNews obligated to not lie? And more importantly, #WheresMitch?
Class was in session this morning! I was thrilled to offer some insights on Twitter and social media to my. colleagues this morning. Now Majority @WhipClyburn is teaching me what all the bells mean in the Capitol 😂
Excited to have made my first remarks on the House floor today! ⬇️
Perks of being in the Democratic Caucus: I will be teaching a Twitter class tomorrow morning open to all members 👩🏽‍🏫🐣
He’s not in the cloak room He’s not in the Capitol He’s not in the Russel building He’s not on the floor of the Senate And 800,000 people still don’t have their paychecks - so #WheresMitch?
Also: @LaurenUnderwood was presiding over the chamber. She was the “Madame Speaker” we were addressing ☺️
800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and we’re pushing to get them paid ASAP. We’re here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why can’t we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs?
After looking for Mitch McConnell with @KatieHill4CA, @LaurenUnderwood, @JahanaHayesCT &amp; others to deliver our letter asking for the Senate to do their job, I returned to this loving surprise. Thank you all so much for your support. I’ll keep these up as long as they stick! 💜
I could’ve sat there quietly as the far right tore me to shreds (they were guaranteed to do so the moment a woman like me won my primary), or I could fight back+not let them. I chose to define myself instead of allowing them to take that away from me. And that’s why they’re mad.
I’m uneasy about it too. It’s stressful &amp; scary, but it’s also out of my control, so the best thing I can do is try to focus that attention on the most urgent issues of our time: climate change, good gov, jobs, wages, justice; and highlight the contradictions you explain here.

It’s a huge win. Obviously there is work to do - there are other money committees (Ways &amp; Means, Energy &amp; Commerce, etc). But we’ve got one down. Before we had 0. Keep paying attention, chipping into campaigns, and being activists. It works.
I cannot stress how important this moment is. Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St. All because: 1. Everyday people donated to our campaigns, and 2. They started to pay attention + became activists in Congress
These legislators, under public pressure, couldn’t deliver as much for big bank lobbyists. They had to vacate one of the most powerful committees in the House. That made a space that big banks couldn’t fill, and how we got *several* non-Corp funded members into places of power.
All of a sudden, it became harder for legislators to slip corporate-friendly legislation through committee, because people would write articles and their constituents would find out and grow upset. As I’ve said before, it’s People vs Money. We’ve got people, they’ve got money.
All of a sudden, normal people whose student loans were bubbling, whose mortgages were underwater, and so on, started showing up to committee hearings. Including this guy: Monopoly Man The idea was to show legislators that everyday people were watching.
Fin Services is one of few exclusive committees. The jargon around here is that they are the “money committees,” not bc they oversee money,but bc one can fundraise from special interests by sitting on it and giving corporations a listening ear. Until people started paying attn.
Activists zoomed in on one place in particular: the Financial Services Committee, which deals with big banks, real estate, and almost every interaction people have in dealing with their own money. What they found was a place where big bank lobbyists were slipping in their work.
During + after the 2008 financial crisis, everyday people started to viscerally see the corrosive role of lobbyists writing in legal loopholes that allowed big banks to gamble with people’s lives and the economy as a whole. Occupy Wall Street emerged, and activism bloomed.
I want to be very clear about how successful the work of grassroots organizers and activists have been in helping Progressives secure appointments to the powerful Financial Services Committee. It starts, as w/ many amazing developments, w/ everyday people paying attention.
More info on his re-election struggle via @ryangrim:
We have secured enough Republican votes in the Senate to reopen government. Our obstacle now is Mitch McConnell, who won’t call the vote for what seems like 2 reasons: 1. He won’t operate independently of Trump 2. He’s putting his own re-election ahead of 800,000 working people
Right now the President is more interested in photo-ops than getting people their paychecks. I’m proud of my colleagues for staying strong despite his bad-faith offer after he threw a temper tantrum at @SpeakerPelosi. He should reopen government and introduce his wall then.
Personally, I’m looking forward to digging into the student loan crisis, examining for-profit prisons/ICE detention, and exploring the development of public &amp; postal banking. To start. 🙂
Financial Services is one of just four exclusive committees in the House. It oversees big banks, lending, &amp; the financial sector. I am very grateful for the opportunity to sit on this committee as a freshman, and look forward to working under the leadership of @RepMaxineWaters!

Reminder of our current dystopian outcomes:
Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” &amp; “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”
Explaining marginal taxes to a far-right former Governor: Imagine if you did chores for abuela &amp; she gave you $10. When you got home, you got to keep it, because it’s only $10. Then we taxed the billionaire in town because he’s making tons of money underpaying the townspeople.
Seriously
Misinformation**
Oh? What’s that? The majority of Americans respect when you break down reasonable policy proposals that are designed to combat runaway income inequality and help fund priorities they value most? We can win public sentiment, stand our ground, &amp; not be scared by GOP information.
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. King’s district should start working to replace him in 2020. Regardless of party, it’s not good for a district if their Rep has such reprehensible views that they aren’t allowed to touch legislation with a 10 ft pole.
Tonight, Rep. Steve King was stripped of all his committee assignments for his embrace of white supremacy. He will not serve on a single committee for the next 2 years of the 116th Congress. Committee assignments are powerful. Members spend years working for their desired spot.
Thank you for pointing this out. I often in public remarks preceded this by saying “with the exception of Native peoples and African Americans,” but apologize for leaving it out of this tweet. I’ll be more careful moving forward!

So very proud of LA public school teachers today for taking a stand. Teachers are the unsung heroes of American democracy. Today they’re putting everything on the line so our nation’s children can have a better shot.
Journalism isn’t just about the questions you ask, but the questions you don’t. If you’re a reporter or pundit who has badgered every Dem about “socialism” yet aren’t asking EVERY Republican about what they plan to do about Rep. King’s white supremacy,you’re telling on yourself.
The difference is that this current GOP admin appeals to the worst within us, stoking an impulse to rationalize erosion. I believe we must appeal to the best within us+not settle. We should champion the smartest, prosperous, fair, hardest-working + decent version of ourselves.
When I meet everyday people, they are eager to learn more, ask great questions, &amp; embrace nuance. I inherently reject the paternalistic idea that some subjects are too complex for everyday people to engage. If we present compelling, solid info+common sense arguments, we can win.
I’d say we’d be taxing 70% of Trump’s income, but he probably hasn’t made more than $10 million in years - and that’s the real reason he’s hiding his taxes 😉
I bartended for *years* in New York City. I understand guys like this like the back of my hand. We got under his skin 😂⬇️

Touches on a larger point: w/ low pay, multiple jobs, a burning planet, war on drugs &amp; few protections for the LGBT+, the political status quo has done so little for so many that when regular people win, we don’t feel as though we owe it much of anything at all. Why not change?

The thing Republicans taking cheap shots forget to mention is that it’s about having trouble affording a SECOND apartment. I live in the Bronx and work in DC. Need a spot in both. But I understand how they can’t conceive of a life where people don’t casually maintain 2 homes.
Fun fact: @chrislhayes is from the Bronx too!
... should someone tell him 😂
When the brand is so strong random bypassers act as a Bronx group chat 🙅🏿‍♂️🙅🏽‍♀️
Is it weird that I love that this is posted by the NYT Metro account? You can take the girl out of the BX, but you can’t take the BX out of the girl 🥰
“Seeds.” Out of the minority of seats they have in Congress, the GOP allowed a white supremacist to represent ~700,000 people. Republicans won’t even censure him. They also protect a president who can’t bring himself to condemn neo-Nazis. Those aren’t seeds. They’re redwoods.
You’d say “that’s cool, but not the same thing as this very crucial electorate, maybe hire someone from the Midwest w/ intimate understanding” and they just throw their hands up and say “now you’re calling me racist?” It’s like that ??? meme but reading the newspaper every day
Like, imagine if the world was flipped &amp; CBS hired an all-poc team to cover 2020, &amp; someone said “hey, white voters are really influential in presidential elections, especially in the Midwest. You should have some white journos who get that” &amp; someone said “I found a Serbian guy”
Also I never called anyone racist, just inadequate. Also never called for strict quotas, just having representation of one of the most fundamental voting blocs in the American electorate.
I keep thinking about this exchange bc there are many aspects that are concerning to hear from an *editor.* This is what false equivalence looks like: diminishing Trump‘s “enemy of the people” talk as “scolding” &amp; describing my call to hire a black journalist as the same thing.
One of the most important things people can do to get big money out of politics is small recurring monthly donations. (You can see the monthly button on this link) It’s like Netflix, but for unbought members of Congress. It’s why I can act independently.
I often find that some members who have to do call time the most are very enthusiastic about getting money out of politics. Members do want less obligations to lobbyists &amp; more leg. work, but some House races cost &lt; $10 million; &amp; that’s *every 2 years* before outside spending!
This week I learned some members spend as little as 5 hours per WEEK in their office bc their fundraising commitments are so high. It’s not them, it’s our broken system of campaign finance. Bc I rely on recurring small dollar donors ( !), I can do my job.
Y’all, I don’t believe he was being condescending. It was a genuine response 💜
Tired: AOC Instagram Live notifications Wired: AOC Legislative action notifications
This week I cosponsored bills in support of DC statehood (HR51), repeal of PAYGO, comprehensive voting reform (HR1), and a bunch of other things, so it‘s already begun. I’m dropping my first original resolution soon 🔥 it’s like a mixtape, but with way more nerdy producers
Now I am tempted to change my Twitter name to: “Alexandria ‘looked racially diverse (at least based on last names)’ Ocasio-Cortez”
Do you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics? And to American history? One race isn’t substitutable for another. It doesn’t work like that. It’s not about “quotas.” It’s about understanding the country you’re living in.
Or: maybe having powerful editorial positions awash in people from one race, class, or gender isn’t a good idea; since we get 1000% more takes on “brown lady says a curse word” than an actual white supremacist in Congress. If you won’t look the mirror, people will do it for you.
This WH admin has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have, yet @CBSNews hasn’t assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election. Unacceptable in 2019. Try again.
The President’s actions have been so destabilizing + destructive that the FBI had to open inquiry on whether the most powerful person in the United States is actually working for Russia. Reminder: Trump has currently shut down the Federal government.
Can I move that all of Fox News’ “Pinocchios” be renamed “Lloronas”? 😂
How can the GOP expect all TSA &amp; other workers to reliably show up without a paycheck? Workers rely on services like childcare and transit to work in the first place. Those services don’t take IOUs. It’s not that workers “refuse” to work w/o a paycheck. Without pay, many can’t.
These are some GOP Senators blocking gov, but workable. Call them, @ them, visit them, &amp; ask they give workers their paychecks without the wall: - WV: @SenCapito - AK: @lisamurkowski - GA: @SenatorIsakson - FL: @marcorubio Many more in this article:
Do people realize how insanely dangerous of an idea it is to support *this President* in fabricating a “national emergency” over immigrants, especially when Homeland Security officially assessed the threat level at the southern border “minimal?” No way. Pressure your Senators.
Actually, the real way out is for GOP Senators to vote to reopen government, give people their paychecks, and fight for their wall another day. To the aide that deemed nat’l emergency an “elegant” solution: tell that to the 1000s of US immigrants endangered by such a decision.
Thank you for being open. It’s time we call it what it is.
At this point those who use the terms “racially tinged” or “racially charged” to describe white supremacy should be prepared to explain why they chose to employ those terms instead of “racist”/“racism.” If the answer is their own discomfort, they’re protecting the wrong people.
You spelled “racist” wrong.
Three easy ways for the GOP to stop feeling sorry for themselves: ✅ Give honest, working people their pay back ✅ Pass legislation that actually helps people ✅ Stop asking the Koch Brothers’ permission to go to the bathroom
To quote Alan Moore: “None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with YOU. You're locked up in here with ME.” 🤣
New party, who dis?
What blows my mind is how GOP would think a *fake* nude photo is worse than *actual* sexual assault. We’ve seen in the past that Republicans are fine w/ their own members committing sexual assault. Yet they believe a nude should end a woman’s career?
Impostor syndrome isn’t an internal issue. It’s one that can be encouraged externally. It’s not delusional to think you’re undeserving, even if you’ve overcome great odds, when some stand to benefit from casting you as such. That’s why we lift each other’s light.
This week I’m bringing the boogie back to Congress with @TheRevAl 💃🏽🕺🏾
Thank you! This is beautiful 💜
#LegalizeIt, and demand justice for communities ravaged by the War on Drugs.
Let’s learn about this, shall we? Many have recognized that @FoxNews has crossed a line beyond conservatism and into outright bigotry with their financing of Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. Tucker finances the @DailyCaller, which posted fake nudes of me. Here’s a breakdown⬇️
The real question is, at what point is their nonstop, targeted behavior considered harassment?
a) this is not an apology b) you’ve been posting hysteric, misrepresentative articles about me nonstop - many within 24h. The @DailyCaller, funded by @TuckerCarlson (at @FoxNews), has a well-documented relationship with white supremacy. Unsurprising they’re targeting me.
For those out of the loop, Republicans began to circulate a fake nude photo of me. The @DailyCaller reposted it (!) and refused to indicate it was fake in the title as well. Completely disgusting behavior from Conservative outlets. No wonder they defended Kavanaugh so fiercely.
GOP have been losing their mind + frothing at the mouth all week, so this was just a matter of time. There is also a Daily Mail reporter (Ruth Styles) going to my boyfriend’s relative’s homes+offering them cash for “stories.” Women in leadership face more scrutiny. Period.
If they want to make an example out of me, I will gladly be one. Hopefully we can be an example of dedication, courage, and persistence under fire. Or compassion, thoughtfulness, curiosity, justice, and zeal. I also hope to be an example of not tolerating nonsense, too.
🤣 ok this was great, flagged you to our team
You know it! 💪🏽💜
“Build a wall of steel, a wall as high as Heaven” against immigrants. - 1924 Ku Klux Klan convention We know our history, and we are determined not to repeat its darkest hour. America is a nation of immigrants. Without immigrants, we are not America.
Looking forward to joining @maddow tonight to discuss the vast social + economic blessing immigrants represent in American society - and our work to reopen the government to end the GOP’s taking hostage of everyday workers’ pay.
The President defended Neo-Nazis who murdered a woman in Charlottesville. The Dept of Justice sued him for not renting to Black tenants. He launched his campaign by calling Mexicans “rapists.” He banned Muslims. The President is racist. And that should make you uncomfortable.
The American people did not organize the biggest midterm election in ~100 years so their new leaders could sit back as the nation waits in crisis. Our class was elected for a very specific reason: to lead differently, propose bold ideas,and create positive change for all people.
Same difference
Let’s refocus our energy and coverage to policies instead of personality. Right now, 800,000 workers are without a paycheck. The President is holding gov operations hostage so that he can build a monument to himself on the southern border that the maj of Americans don’t want.
Naturally, the same week we kick-start a nat’l convo on marginal tax rates endorsed by Nobel-Prize winning economists, I’m being described as “vacuous.” If you’re allowed to characterize female politicians as “unlikeable,” are we allowed to describe takes like these “resentful?”
He’s almost got it! Just a few corrections: * Single-payer healthcare * Ending unjust wars * 70% *marginal* tax rate on multimillion incomes
Thank you TN Gov. @BillHaslam for your decision to grant clemency to Cyntoia Brown. We must reform our criminal justice system so that cases like Cyntoia’s don’t happen. Until then, it is up to leaders across the country with the moral compass to make decisions like these.
This is why we question, by the way - because women, people of color, immigrants, LGBT+, &amp; the poor have been treated unfairly in the past. And when many of the decision-making rooms aren’t as diverse as they should be, communities fairly ask: “is it happening to us, again?”
To make*
It *must* be said in a nuanced conversation that questioning where takes come from is nowhere near the same as undermining the extraordinary work reporters and journalists do as “fake news.” Helping people understand where these takes come from help guard against those attacks.
I’m not challenging that I was checked - I think the check is a very fair one to masked, and that the coverage illuminated the issue far more than my tweet did. I *am* confused by the equivalence of the check to other similarly-rated claims that seem much more severe.
Fact-checking is critically important. It’s not always fun. But that’s okay! It pushes me to be better. It’s important that if fact-checkers are referees, everyone know the rules - and those rules be as clear + fair as possible for all to play. Thank you for the work you do.
Thank you for sharing @washingtonpost’s rubric! Except the standard for “4 Pinocchios” just says: “Whoppers.” That’s it. “Whoppers.” As an official fact checking standard. Cheeky, but really not okay to be held to a jokey standard when 45 is advancing conspiracy theories.
Thank you @PolitiFact! 💜
This is helpful! Thank you. I do think it is important to point out that there is still admitted discretion: “we select the most newsworthy+significant ones.” That means no real standard. So it’s still fair to ask why a controversial WH Press Sec is getting let off so easy.
(Also: credit for “facts are facts, America” goes to the illustrious queen Monique Hart)
This is where I’m seeing those numbers of checks: SHS: AOC:
Another question for @politifact: some officials’ statements (ex. Andrew Cuomo) get rated “true” frequently. I say true things all the time - I’d hope most do. When does Politifact choose to rate true statements? Is there a guide? I’d be happy to repost if there is.
Or why did @washingtonpost give my confusing tweet on military accounting offsets the same “Pinocchios” as Trump’s flat denial of how many Americans died in Puerto Rico? These are legitimate questions not intended to attack. Who makes these decisions? How? Is there a rubric?
For example, it looks like @PolitiFact has fact-checked Sarah Huckabee Sanders and myself the *same* amount of times: 6. She’s been serving for almost 2 years. I’ve served 4 days. Why is she fact-checked so little? Is she adhering to some standard we don’t know about?
Facts are facts, America. We should care about getting things right. Yet standards of who gets fact-checked, how often + why are unclear. This is where false equivalency+bias creeps in, allowing climate deniers to be put on par w/scientists, for example.
.@CillizzaCNN - looks like your ‘character count’ argument to avoid including my full quote is straight up wrong. Also: where are all the “Pinocchios” for Republicans this week (many of whom are much more senior than me) blatantly lying about marginal tax rates?
“And whenever I make a mistake, I say, "OK, this was clumsy." and then I restate what my point was. But it's— it's not the same thing as— as the President lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all.” - the next sentence Cover the quote in context, thanks.
It did! Can’t go to work without bringing a piece of home with me - thank you @QueensLibrary ☕️💜
Here is one perfect example: many of ICE’s black-box detention centers are run by for-profit corporations. That means our public dollars are going to sky-high profits for private prison operators and their shareholders.
This admin clearly had enough extra money to spontaneously build child detention camps all along the southern border + conduct a massive, cross-country family-separation operation. If anything, DHS’s horrific actions last year means we should consider budget cuts, not increases.
Mother Ru, Thank you for your shining example of loving ourselves in our entirety, no matter what the world thinks. You give me hope and strength every day!
¡Felíz Día de los Tres Reyes! 🐪🤴🏾🎁 Happy Three Kings Day everyone!
If the GOP wants a wall so badly, they can try to propose and pass a bill like anybody else. Instead, they are seizing gov operations + innocent people’s pay until they get what they want. This is called hostage-taking. And no one can compromise or negotiate with that.
“She doesn’t know what she’s talking about,” say Republicans, who argued that healthcare costs the same as as unlimited calls &amp; texts. At least they’re upholding the time-honored tradition of laymen doubting the intelligence of women with actual subject matter education.
A quick note to you all. Let us never, ever, ever give up.
💜
You’re the GOP Minority Whip. How do you not know how marginal tax rates work? Oh that’s right, almost forgot: GOP works for the corporate CEOs showering themselves in multi-million💰bonuses; not the actual working people whose wages + healthcare they’re ripping off for profit.

YUP. BX is seizing the throne, now that Brooklyn has been taken over by bespoke quiche spots or whatever you weird L train people did down there 😆
GOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals. If anything, this dude is a walking argument to tax misogyny at 100% 😉 Republicans rob everyone the opportunity of real policy debate by resorting to this.
Having 🔥 Twitter game is not a hiring requirement for my policy team, but they bring it anyway ⬇️
I got your back @RashidaTlaib - the Bronx and Detroit ride together 💪🏽💜
Republican hypocrisy at its finest: saying that Trump admitting to sexual assault on tape is just “locker room talk,” but scandalizing themselves into faux-outrage when my sis says a curse word in a bar. GOP lost entitlement to policing women’s behavior a long time ago. Next.
The Queen has spoken!
Thank you @cher! We can fix Congress and have fun doing it - who says we can’t multitask? 😉💜
It means so much that one of the first bills we’re cosponsoring in Congress, #PAYGO repeal, is with my fellow sisters in service @AyannaPressley, @RashidaTlaib, @IlhanMN &amp; more! Also, shout out to @JoeNeguse of CO - he was down for #GreenNewDeal on Day 1 + now PAYGO repeal too!
Merci beaucoup!
Yesterday we started a convo w/ the rules pkg about ending #PAYGO, a political policy lacking economic merit that sabotages progress where Americans value it most: healthcare, education, housing, &amp; more. Today I’m proud to cosponsor legislation w/ @RepJayapal to end it.
Lip+hoops were inspired by Sonia Sotomayor, who was advised to wear neutral-colored nail polish to her confirmation hearings to avoid scrutiny. She kept her red. Next time someone tells Bronx girls to take off their hoops, they can just say they’re dressing like a Congresswoman.
I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! 💃🏽 Have a great weekend everyone :)
Progressives gained some important ground negotiating around yesterday’s rules package. One was that @SpeakerPelosi has agreed to seat *every* House committee with 40% Progressive Caucus members. The other: @RepJayapal &amp; @MarkPocan secured 1st-ever hearings on #MedicareForAll.
Sometimes we take for granted exactly how radical ideas like Social Security, the VA, and public schooling really are: that we will care for our elders, provide healthcare, and educate *all* children in America free of cost at the point of service.
I wore all-white today to honor the women who paved the path before me, and for all the women yet to come. From suffragettes to Shirley Chisholm, I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the mothers of the movement. ⬇️
Over 200 members voted for Nancy Pelosi today, yet the GOP only booed one: me. Don’t hate me cause you ain’t me, fellas 💁🏽‍♀️
